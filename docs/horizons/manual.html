<p>Version 4.94 (September 6, 2022)</p>

<h3 id="purpose-and-scope">Purpose and Scope</h3>

<p>The JPL Horizons on-line ephemeris system provides access to solar system
data and customizable production of accurate ephemerides for observers,
mission-planners, researchers, and the public, by numerically characterizing
the location, motion, and observability of solar system objects as a function
of time, as seen from locations within the solar system.</p>

<p>Available objects include 1,229,000+ asteroids, 3822 comets, 211 natural
satellites, all planets, the Sun, 202 spacecraft, and several dynamical points
such as Earth-Sun L1, L2, L4, L5, Earth-Moon L1, L2, L4, L5 and planetary
system barycenters. Ephemerides, lighting, and visibility for points on the
surface of distant bodies may also be generated.</p>

<p>Aberrated sky location angles and angular rates can be characterized using
right-ascension and declination in three coordinate systems, along with azimuth
and elevation, sky-motion rates, and position angle, as a function of time
and observer location.  For comets and asteroids, corresponding statistical
uncertainties and plane-of-sky error ellipse parameters can be generated as
a function of time.</p>

<p>Target visibility in the sky can be assessed with magnitude, extinction,
airmass, and visual signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) relative to background sky
brightening caused by atmosphere-scattered moonlight, with Sun and Moon
sky-presence and twilight-dawn indicators.</p>

<p>Target-body rise, maximum elevation, transit, and set may be identified
along with eclipse circumstances for non-Earth natural satellites.</p>

<p>Sub-observer and sub-solar cartographic latitude and longitude can be returned
for targets (or sites on targets) having defined rotational models.</p>

<p>Close-approaches by asteroids and comets to planetary bodies (and sixteen of
the largest asteroids) can be rapidly and automatically identified, along with
their encounter uncertainties and impact probabilities.</p>

<p>Tables of vectors or osculating orbital elements of one body with respect to
another can be produced to characterize relative motion and orbit geometry as
a function of time.</p>

<p>SPK binary file output can be plugged into user programs to reproduce the
numerically integrated time-continuous state of small-body targets at any
instant for remote usage. The SPK files can be used by existing visualization,
animation and mission-design software that incorporate appropriate SPICE
Toolkit readers.</p>

<p>In total, more than 100 different observational and physical aspect quantities
can be requested at intervals for both topocentric and geocentric situations in
one of 9 coordinate systems and 4 time scales (TDB, TT, UT, Civil).</p>

<p>Users may conduct parameter searches of the comet/asteroid database, searching
for objects based on combinations of up to 42 different parameters, or define
their own objects by specifying heliocentric IAU76/80 osculating elements, then
use the system to accurately integrate the trajectory. Geocentric SGP4/SDP4
Two-Line Element (TLE) format data can also be specified and propagated by users
to define an Earth-orbiting artificial satellite.</p>

<p>Over 2300 predefined Earth station locations are available, along with sites
on other major bodies, in addition to being able to use spacecraft as
“observing sites” from which to generate relative ephemerides. Users may define
their own topocentric observing site coordinates on any planet or natural
satellite having a known rotational model, if the desired site is not
predefined.</p>

<p>The underlying solar system data from which output is derived is kept current
to reflect the latest measurements, models, and solutions. It is typically the
same data used at JPL for radar astronomy, mission planning, and spacecraft
navigation.</p>

<p>Results are suitable for tracking systems, observers, mission planners, and
other researchers, although such determination is ultimately the users’
responsibility.</p>

<p>The information is grouped into five general types of customizable output
requests:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Observables (plane-of-sky angles, rates, visibility, physical aspect)</li>
  <li>Osculating orbital elements</li>
  <li>Cartesian state vectors</li>
  <li>Close approaches to planets and 16 largest asteroids</li>
  <li>SPK binary trajectory files (asteroids and comets only)</li>
</ol>

<p>The first four are ASCII tables containing output at user-specified discrete
time-steps. SPK requests return time-continuous binary files. Output is returned
to the user via screen display, API query, e-mail, or FTP protocols. Table
types 1-3 can be requested in a format suitable for spreadsheet import.</p>

<h3 id="overview-of-usage">Overview of Usage</h3>

<p>There are four supported ways to access the program. All can be automated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Browser (passive interactive GUI interface):
    <ol>
      <li>Point your browser to <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html">https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html</a></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>API (GET and POST programmatic interface)
    <ol>
      <li>See documentation at <a href="https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/doc/horizons.html">https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/doc/horizons.html</a></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Command-line (full access, active interactive prompt-based interface):
    <ol>
      <li>Connect keyboard directly to the system <code>telnet ssd.jpl.nasa.gov 6775</code>.<br />
 No account or password is required.</li>
      <li>Specify an object to get a summary data screen.</li>
      <li>Follow prompts. At any prompt, type <code>?</code> or <code>?!</code> for short or long
 explanations of the prompt.</li>
      <li>Transmit results to your system by e-mail or FTP</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>E-mail (full access, except for SPK file production, batch interface):
    <ol>
      <li>Send e-mail to <code>horizons@ssd.jpl.nasa.gov</code> with subject “<code>BATCH-LONG</code>”.</li>
      <li>An example command file will be mailed back to you.</li>
      <li>Edit this text file, then mail it back with the subject header “<code>JOB</code>”</li>
      <li>Results of your request are mailed back to you.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Horizons system was intended to be easy to use and should have a
step-function learning curve. The main requirement to get started is
understanding how connect to the system and then select “target” objects.</p>

<p>The remainder of this documentation summarizes details of system capabilities
and interpretation of the output. Check the end of each ephemeris generated
for a specific explanation of what was returned.</p>

<p>This document often describes “typing” certain things, presupposing the
interactive command-line interface is being used. If one is instead using the
browser interface, these operations are typically done by using a pull down
menu or check-box. The e-mail and API interfaces typically involve setting
an appropriate command-file variable to accomplish the same thing.</p>

<p>While using the command-line interface, type “?” or “?!” at any prompt for
an explanation of options. Type ‘-‘ at any prompt to move backward to the
previous prompt. ‘x’ exits the system immediately.</p>

<p>See the <a href="#acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a> section for contact information.</p>

<p>To be actively alerted to major changes such as new capabilities and operational
changes, subscribe to the announcements list. It is generally low-traffic and
has historically been used once or twice a year:</p>

<p><a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/email_list.html">https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/email_list.html</a></p>

<p>A more frequently updated ‘system news’ is also available by typing “news”
within the command-line interface, or from the URL below. ‘News’ reports all
significant changes, not just major changes, and can include supplementary
information on system usage, but you have to actively check it:</p>

<h2 id="a-idconnect-classanchor-under-tabaconnecting-to-the-system"><a id="connect" class="anchor-under-tab"></a>Connecting to the System</h2>

<h3 id="command-line">Command-line</h3>

<p>The Horizons on-line ephemeris and data system is available as a command-line
terminal service. This is intended for people who want quick access to all
program features with an interactive keyboard-type interface. User response
to a series of guided-prompts sets up the desired output.</p>

<p>From a telnet-capable machine, running a “VT100”-type terminal model,
connect to “<code>ssd.jpl.nasa.gov 6775</code>”:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>From UNIX/LINUX/MacOSX command line:</p>

    <p><code>telnet ssd.jpl.nasa.gov 6775</code></p>

    <p>… where <code>6775</code> is a required port number.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatively, from within a web-browser that supports telnet, enter
a URL of this form:</p>

    <p><code>telnet://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov:6775</code></p>

    <p>However, few modern browsers may recognize this form without additional
configuration by the user.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The system will start a terminal session automatically. No user-ID or password
is required.  If the connection is refused, the two most likely causes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The port number was not specified or passed along by software:
    <ul>
      <li>A few PC-type telnet programs do not to fully implement the telnet
protocol and may not pass the port number to the network, or may need
to be reconfigured to function properly, or may have a different
syntax for specifying port numbers. Check your users’ guide for
information.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There is a firewall security restriction at your end
    <ul>
      <li>Contact your local computer system administrator in this case. Since
no password or security information is exchanged, you may be able to
request a firewall exception from your institution (“poke a hole”).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The command-line interface can be automated. However, this is no longer
recommended given the APIs introduced in 2021. Deprecated example scripts may
be found in the FTP directory &lt;fhttps://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/ftp/xfr/SCRIPTS/&gt; and
will be supported indefinately.</p>

<p>Command-line capability can be restored to recent MacOS systems if necessary
using these two commands from within a Mac terminal window connected to the
Internet:</p>

<p><code>ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"</code></p>

<p><code>brew install inetutils</code></p>

<p>This installs ‘telnet’ and ‘ftp’ commands used for Mac terminal connections.
However, file retrieval can be done without FTP using the already-available
‘curl’ terminal command:. For example,</p>

<p><code>curl -s "https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/ftp/ssd/SCRIPTS/README"</code></p>

<h3 id="web">Web</h3>

<p>Point your browser to: <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html">https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html</a></p>

<p>This graphical interface is intended for the more casual user or general public
but offers access to program features using pull-down menus, fill-in boxes
and clickable buttons.</p>

<p>Users should verify default settings such as timescale, coordinate system,
and desired output quantities are appropriate and as intended for the run.</p>

<h3 id="api">API</h3>

<p>An API designed for direct programmatic access and automation
(“machine-to-machine”) is available. Query parameters are specified either on
a URL (GET), or in a file provided to the API when it is called (POST).</p>

<p>Documentation specific to the API interface is here:</p>

<p>GET   (URL encoded requests):</p>

<p><a href="https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/doc/horizons.html">https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/doc/horizons.html</a></p>

<p>POST (file-based requests) :</p>

<p><a href="https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/doc/horizons_file.html">https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/doc/horizons_file.html</a></p>

<h3 id="e-mail">E-mail</h3>

<p>Horizons can also be controlled by sending e-mail messages to the address</p>

<p>horizons@ssd.jpl.nasa.gov</p>

<p>System action is determined by the e-mail “subject” set by the user.</p>

<p>The e-mail “programming-like” interface is generally for those who want access
to most program features without the overhead of answering prompts or
manipulating graphical interfaces; generally those already familiar with what
the program does and who know what they want, and who might have local firewall
problems with other interfaces.</p>

<p>You might set up an input file that does what you want once, and then make only
minor changes to it thereafter, such as specifying a different object for a new
run.</p>

<p>An example usage-case for the e-mail interface might be generation of
rise-transit-set times for an object over decades. The request (or series of
requests) can be submitted by email. Results will be returned when complete
without the user having to be present, keep a connection open, or monitor a
potentially lengthy process; a “fire and forget” mode of operation.</p>

<p>It offers the additional ability of allowing users to specify up to 10000
discrete times (to aid astrometric reduction) and up to 200 objects at once,
although results are returned as a separate e-mail for each object. The e-mail
interface does not currently allow the SPK file production available using the
command-line interface or API.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: Please be sure your email client is sending content as plain ASCII
text. Not doing so may result in no response from the system or an error
message, even when your command-file appears perfectly normal from within your
email client.</p>

<p>E-mail requests to Horizons may be most practical for those working in a
UNIX/Linux/MacOS terminal or command-line environment, with plain-text
programming-type editors available such as vi, emacs, atom, sublime, and
with mailers like mailx, or similar.</p>

<p>Modern graphical e-mail systems (gmail, Outlook, etc.) often assume they are
communicating with other e-mail systems like themselves and insert hidden font
and formatting codes that Horizons cannot currently interpret. There can also
be issues with 8-bit character sets, such as generated by keyboards set up
for use with non-US languages.</p>

<p>A helpful (if dated) guide to suitably configuring some email clients for
plain-text is available via this link:</p>

<p><a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/dat/Configuring_Mail_Clients_to_Send_Plain_ASCII_Text.pdf">https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/dat/Configuring_Mail_Clients_to_Send_Plain_ASCII_Text.pdf</a></p>

<p>… but, in general, consult your mailer’s documentation on how to activate any
plain-text mode that might be available.</p>

<p>To get started with the e-mail interface, send e-mail to the above address
with the subject “BATCH-LONG”. The latest, fully-commented example command-file
will be mailed back. Edit this file to produce the results you want, then mail
back with the subject “JOB”.</p>

<p>Note that the e-mail command file that is returned returned defines the
identical settings used by the API interface, so is relevant there also.</p>

<p>Recognized e-mail commands in the “Subject:” line are:</p>

<pre>
SUBJECT HEADER  MEANING
--------------  -----------------------------------------------------------
JOB             Horizons run-stream
DOC-TEXT        Request ASCII (plain-text) version of current documentation
DOC-PS          Request PostScript version of current documentation
BATCH-LONG      Request latest fully commented example batch file
BATCH-BRIEF     Request latest example batch file without comments
QUESTION        Message forwarded to cognizant engineer
</pre>

<p>Those automating e-mail interactions with Horizons should take a prudent
approach for best results. For example, space requests at 1-2 seconds before
sending the next. This reduces the chance of requests getting categorized as
spam and diverted at some point along the route, which can happen if a script
tries to send 1000 e-mail requests in 0.1 seconds.</p>

<p>Incoming e-mail requests are queued and processed in the order received, one at
a time. Results will typically be returned within a few seconds, depending on
the request, but can also be delayed minutes or even longer if there are a
number of requests to process ahead of yours, or if the specific request is a
time-consuming by nature, or the receiving mail agent only checks for incoming
at some preset interval.</p>

<p>Separate tools (for example, ‘procmail’) can be used automatically extract
Horizons output from incoming e-mail and deposit in a local file.</p>

<h2 id="a-iddefs-classanchor-under-tabageneral-definitions"><a id="defs" class="anchor-under-tab"></a>General Definitions</h2>

<p>The remainder of this document will use some terms and abbreviations defined
below:</p>

<h3 id="reference-frame">Reference Frame</h3>

<p>The set of three axes at right angles to each other that define the cartesian
(x, y, z) basis directions. The x and y axes define a reference plane from which
declination or latitude is measured. The z-direction is at right angles to
that x-y plane and defines the “pole”. The x-direction defines the origin from
which right ascension or longitude is measured.</p>

<p>Horizons may use – depending on circumstance and sometimes user-request – the
following reference frames:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ICRF (International Celestial Reference Frame, equatorial-aligned radio frame)</li>
  <li>Earth true-of-date (IAU76/80)</li>
  <li>Earth ecliptic of-date (IAU76/80)</li>
  <li>Earth ecliptic at J2000 epoch (IAU76/80)</li>
  <li>IAU body-frame of-date (equatorial)</li>
  <li>Lunar mean Earth (DE421)</li>
  <li>FK4/B1950 (equatorial)</li>
  <li>Earth ecliptic at B1950 epoch</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ecliptic">Ecliptic</h3>

<p>In this reference frame, the x-y plane is based on the orbit of the Earth around
the Sun. Since the Earth’s orbit plane fluctuates slightly due to gravitational
perturbations, the ecliptic chosen can be at a fixed standard time (such as the
J2000.0 epoch 2000-Jan-1.5) providing an inertial frame, or instead the time of
interest (“of-date”), providing a dynamic frame, depending on the purpose. Both
amount to adopting a standard due to definitional ambiguities caused by the
Earth and Moon’s mutual motion affecting the Earth’s orbit plane.</p>

<p>When transforming between the underlying ICRF reference frame, Horizons uses the
IAU76/80 fixed obliquity of 84381.448 arcsec at the J2000.0 standard epoch, and
an associated time-varying model for “of-date” ecliptic.</p>

<p>When transforming between FK4/B1950, a fixed obliquity of 84404.8362512
arcseconds is used at the standard epoch, with an associated time-varying model
for other instants.</p>

<h3 id="north">North</h3>

<p>For planets and natural satellites, the spin-pole direction extending to the
positive side of the plane defined by the solar systems’ positive angular
momentum vector.a For asteroids and comets, north is along the body’s spin-axis
positive angular momentum direction</p>

<h3 id="east">East</h3>

<p>The counter-clockwise direction around the north-pole of rotation.</p>

<h3 id="ra">RA</h3>

<p>Right ascension; the angular distance on the celestial sphere counter-clockwise
(eastward) along the celestial equator from the reference equinox to the
meridian of the object.  RA is analogous to longitude, with the plane containing
the equinox defining zero RA much as the Greenwich meridian defines zero
longitude.  There are different types of RA, described below, depending on what
coordinate system and aberrations are requested. Values are expressed in
sexagesimal time units of hours, minutes, and seconds OR decimal angular
degrees, as requested.</p>

<h3 id="dec">DEC</h3>

<p>Declination; the angular distance on the celestial sphere north (positive)
or south (negative) of the reference frame equator. It is analogous to latitude.
As with RA,  there are different types of DEC, described below, depending on
what coordinate system and aberrations are requested. Usually expressed in
decimal angular degrees.</p>

<h3 id="az">AZ</h3>

<p>Azimuth; the angle measured clockwise from the north along the horizon
defined by the plane perpendicular to the local zenith to the point where the
meridian passing through local zenith and the object intersects the horizon
plane.</p>

<h3 id="el">EL</h3>

<p>Elevation; the angular distance above or below the plane perpendicular to
the local zenith. Note this plane is not necessarily the visible horizon, due
to station elevation – the “horizon dip” effect.</p>

<h3 id="geometric-coordinates">Geometric Coordinates</h3>

<p>The instantaneous (“true”) position of a body at a particular instant. These
coordinates are referred to the x-y basis of a particular reference frame
(ICRF or FK4/B1950 or their standard ecliptic variations) and primarily of
interest to those doing dynamical modeling.</p>

<h3 id="astrometric-coordinates">Astrometric Coordinates</h3>

<p>Positions or values (such as RA and DEC) which account for the finite but
varying amount of time it takes light to travel from the target to the observer,
expressed with respect to the x-y basis definitions of a particular inertial
reference frame, such as ICRF or FK4/B1950.</p>

<p>When an object is at some position, an observer far away will still see it
at a prior position that depends on how far away the observer is, due to the
finite speed of light</p>

<p>Astrometric coordinates are generally used when comparing positions to nearby
stars in a star catalog. Nearby catalog stars experience essentially the same
aberrational position shift due to observer motion such that stellar aberration
is not considered when comparing to nearby stars.</p>

<h3 id="apparent-coordinates">Apparent Coordinates</h3>

<p>Positions or values (like RA and DEC) which take into account factors that
appear to change the target position with respect to the background coordinate
system: light-time, the deflection of light due to large or nearby masses, and
stellar aberration.</p>

<p>Apparent coordinates can be with respect to an inertial frame such as ICRF or
FK4/B1950, such as for space-based observers (spacecraft) or, for observers on
a rotating surface, with respect to some “of-date” coordinate system, involving
precession-nutation to the Earth’s true-equator and equinox-of-date (or that of
a non-Earth body associated with the observer location).</p>

<p>Apparent positions are usually of interest to telescope systems on the surface
of rotating body that are aligned with the pole at each instant and carried
along as that pole precesses and nutates.</p>

<p>For space-based systems not linked to a rotating surface, the ICRF or FK4/B1950
inertial reference frame is used, and the aberrations that change apparent
positions relative to that background reference frame are included.</p>

<h3 id="refracted-coordinates">Refracted Coordinates</h3>

<p>Apparent coordinates can additionally be corrected for atmospheric refraction.
Available only for Earth-based sites, this ultimately is a function of the local
atmosphere and weather between target and observer, which can only be
approximately known. Some observatories have developed their own local
refraction tables.</p>

<h3 id="small-body">Small Body</h3>

<p>Refers to a comet or asteroid for which the trajectory is numerically
integrated on demand from an initial set of previously statistically estimated
orbital elements in the JPL database. Typically, no cartographic coordinate
system is available for these objects, but there are a growing number of
exceptions.</p>

<h3 id="major-body">Major Body</h3>

<p>Refers to planet, natural satellite, spacecraft, Sun, barycenter, or other
objects having pre-computed trajectories.</p>

<p>Only major bodies can be coordinate centers (observing sites) in Horizons.
Their state vectors are obtained by interpolating previously defined
ephemerides, such as DE441. Interpolation generally recovers the state to the
millimeter level.</p>

<p>In some special cases, an asteroid or comet can be defined as a major body. An
example might be a particular asteroid solution used for a spacecraft mission
flyby or other historically “fixed” purpose, such as the Eros solution for the
NEAR mission.</p>

<p>In such cases, the particular trajectory is precomputed and stored as a “major
body”, while the objects’ ground-based solution otherwise continues to be
updated in the JPL small-body database as new observations are reported.
Therefore, it may be possible to use either the fixed (historical) major-body
trajectory solution or the “latest” small-body solution. Details for the
specific cases are given in the object’s data-sheet summaries.</p>

<h3 id="target-body">Target Body</h3>

<p>Refers to the object of interest for which an ephemeris is to be created.
Selected by the user. It can be a major-body or small-body.</p>

<h3 id="center-or-coordinate-origin-or-observering-location">Center (or coordinate origin, or observering location)</h3>

<p>This is the point to which output quantities for the target (such as
coordinates) are referred: (0,0,0). It is typically where the observer is
located.</p>

<p>An observation point is “topocentric” if on the surface of a body with a known
rotational state.</p>

<p>If at the center of a physical body, the observing point is “bodycentric” (with
“geocentric” referring to the particular case of origin at the Earth’s center).</p>

<p>If at the center-of-mass of some dynamical system, the center or observer is
“barycentric”.</p>

<h3 id="primary-body">Primary Body</h3>

<p>Refers to closest body about which a target body orbits.  For natural
satellites, this would be a planet, although they orbit the Sun as well.
For planets and small-bodies, the primary body is the Sun.</p>

<h3 id="interfering-body">Interfering Body</h3>

<p>Refers to the largest body in a system other than the one the observer is on,
or the target.</p>

<p>For example, for an observer on the Earth, the “interfering body” is the Moon.
If the observer is on the Moon, the interfering body is the Earth.</p>

<p>The location of the interfering body can be of interest because it can affect
local sky brightness due to its reflectivity and closeness in the sky to the
target.</p>

<h3 id="deflecting-body">Deflecting Body</h3>

<p>Refers to the largest mass in the observers’ system; it can be used to
estimate the gravitational bending (deflection) of light, in addition to that
of the Sun. This can change the apparent position of an object slightly with
respect to the background coordinate system.</p>

<h2 id="a-idselect-classanchor-under-tabaobject-selection"><a id="select" class="anchor-under-tab"></a>Object Selection</h2>

<p>When connecting by command-line, the primary thing one must know to use Horizons
effectively is how to select objects. Once the user gets things started by
selecting an object, everything else is prompted.</p>

<p>Selecting an object can amount to just typing in its name or designation or
IAU number and pressing return, but it is helpful to understand a few more
things to avoid confusion in some situations.</p>

<p>There are two categories of objects in Horizons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Major Bodies</strong> (planets, natural satellites, spacecraft, special cases):</p>

    <p>Major bodies are represented in pre-computed trajectory files which
are interpolated to very accurately retrieve position and velocity
at any instant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Small Bodies</strong> (comets and asteroids):</p>

    <p>Small-bodies have their statistically estimated position and velocity
at one instant compactly stored in a database as initial conditions
and are then numerically integrated on-demand by Horizons, to other
times of interest, using the necessary physics.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These two categories partly result from the objects being stored differently and
partly from the historical overlap in the numbering and naming of bodies.</p>

<p>For example, since there is a natural satellite named Io as well as an
asteroid named Io, there has to be some way to distinguish between them and
it might as well be possible to do that immediately when formulating the
look-up instead of always getting a list back asking “which one?”</p>

<p>When an object is specified, the request is first examined for optional
“keywords” or a semicolon symbol that tells the system more about what is
wanted.</p>

<p>If there aren’t any keywords, the system will then try to match against the
major body list. If a match is found among the list of major bodies, it will
be displayed. If no match is found among the major bodies, it will then
continue on and match against the small-body database.</p>

<p>For example, if you simply input “Io”, it will return a list of matches from
among the major bodies, including the moon of Jupiter, and then stop, waiting
for the user to clarify by uniquely specifying one object. To uniquely specify
Io, enter its unique ID number, “501” (which was displayed on the previous
list of multiple matches).</p>

<p>To instead select the small-body named Io immediately, provide more
information by specifying it one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>Horizons&gt; Io;</code>         (Semi-colon tells Horizons its a small-body look-up)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>Horizons&gt; 85</code>          (No match on major body, so search “falls through”
                         to small-body number look-up)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>Horizons&gt; 85;</code>         (Semi-colon tells Horizons its a small-body look-up)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>Horizons&gt; NAME= Io;</code>   (Keyword “NAME” tells Horizons its an asteroid or
                         comet small-body look-up)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>Horizons&gt; ASTNAM= Io;</code> (Keyword “ASTNAM” tells Horizons its an asteroid name)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Further details, discussion, and examples follow.</p>

<h3 id="major-bodies">Major Bodies</h3>

<p>Type <code>MB</code> to get a list of all major-body strings that can be used to search
on. To select a major body, enter one of the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A string to search on (<code>Mars</code> or <code>Trit</code>). Case insensitive.</li>
  <li>A JPL ID integer code or fragment</li>
  <li>An IAU number</li>
</ol>

<p>Examples (at the main prompt):</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; mars bary</code> (uniquely select Mars barycenter; ‘4’ does the same)</li>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; mars</code>      (list all major bodies with ‘mars’ in an ID field)</li>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; 501</code>       (uniquely select Io)</li>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; N*</code>        (list all major bodies with ‘n’ in an ID field)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once a major-body is uniquely identified, a screen of data will be displayed
for confirmation purposes. This display generally consists of various measured
parameters for the body, drawn from published literature and displayed for
informational purposes.</p>

<p>Note that there is often more than one determination in the literature for many
of the displayed parameters, and that they are subject to revision as more data
are accumulated.</p>

<p>Such display values in major-body data sheets are NOT used in the subsequent
ephemeris calculations. This differs from the small-body confirmation data
screens, which are extracted from a JPL database and ARE what is used to
initialize a Horizons small-body integration.</p>

<p>Planetary systems may have two associated integer ID numbers assigned. Those
greater than 100 and ending in 99 (199, 299, 399, 499, 599, 699, 799, 899, 999)
refer to the planet CENTER only.</p>

<p>To instead select planetary (system) BARYCENTERS, use the numeric ID codes
less than 10 and greater than or equal to 0: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
This selects the center-of-mass the objects in the planetary system move with
respect to, including the planet itself and its natural satellites.</p>

<p>For example, <code>399</code> is the Earth’s center, <code>3</code> is the Earth-Moon Barycenter
point about which the Earth and Moon both move, and <code>301</code> is the center of the
Moon.</p>

<p>For Mercury and Venus, there is no difference between planet-center and
system barycenter (<code>1</code>=<code>199</code>, <code>2</code>=<code>299</code>) as far as Horizons selection is
concerned because there is only the planet: no satellites, so no offset
between planet center and planetary system center-of-mass.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>0</code> and <code>ssb</code> refer to the solar system barycenter (SSB).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>10</code> and <code>sun</code> refer to the center of the Sun.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a planet name is entered, it may not be considered unique if a distinct
system barycenter is available. For example, if <code>Saturn</code> is entered, a list
containing “Saturn” and the “Saturn Barycenter” will be returned. To specify
Saturn (the planet-center), you must use its unique ID code, <code>699</code>.</p>

<p>A unique ID code will be displayed whenever there are multiple matches, to
help users select between objects and unambiguously specify the desired object.
If you can remember the unique ID codes, it is always best to specify them
instead of a name immediately followed by having to enter the code anyway to
resolve the name ambiguity.</p>

<p>System barycenters are available over longer time-spans than planet-centers
because planet-centers are defined by satellite solutions. These satellite
solutions are based on shorter data arcs than the entire system and can
therefore be extrapolated only over shorter time-spans.</p>

<p>For example, the planet Jupiter <code>599</code> might be available over the interval
1600-2500, while the Jupiter system barycenter <code>5</code> is available over 9999 B.C.
to A.D. 9999.</p>

<p>Note that if youintend to generate an osculating orbital element ephemeris, you
may want to specify barycenters to avoid having high frequency local system
orbital motion aliased into the results.</p>

<p>For example, if you request orbital elements of the Earth (<code>399</code>) with respect
to Sun (<code>10</code>), the resulting elements will contain short-period oscillations due
to the Earth’s motion with respect to the Earth-Moon barycenter, as well as the
Sun’s motion with respect to the solar system barycenter. Unless these short
period motions are desired, you might want to instead request <code>3</code> with respect
to <code>0</code> (Earth-Moon barycenter with respect to solar system barycenter).</p>

<h3 id="surface-targets">Surface Targets:</h3>

<p>Horizons can also compute ephemerides for targets that are on the surface of
extended, rotating target bodies (generally, “major bodies”): Moon, Sun,
planets, natural satellites, or other bodies with a defined rotational model.</p>

<p>Example targets might be specific craters, topographic features, or spacecraft
landing sites.</p>

<p>To specify a target on the surface of a major body that has a defined shape and
rotation model, the most general form of input allows two types of coordinates,
both in units of degrees and km:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Geodetic/planetodetic coordinates:</p>

    <p><code>{g: E.Long, latitude, h @ } BODY</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cylindrical coordinates:</p>

    <p><code>{c: E.Long,     DXY, DZ @ } BODY</code></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>… where the brackets {} indicate optional components of the general
specification.</p>

<p>For example, while <code>301</code> specifies the target to be the center of the
Moon, and <code>Apollo-11 @ 301</code> specifies the Apollo-11 landing site as target,
the following …</p>

<p><code>g: 348.8, -43.3, 0 @ 301</code></p>

<p>… specifies an ephemeris for the crater Tycho on the Moon (body 301), at
geodetic (planetodetic) coordinates 348.8 degrees east longitude, -43.3
degrees latitude (south), and zero km altitude with respect to the Moon’s
mean-Earth reference frame and ellipsoid surface.</p>

<p>To input cylindrical coordinates using the “c:” prefix. DXY is distance from
the spin axis in the body equator plane in km. DZ is distance above (+) or
below (-) that plane, also in km.</p>

<p>When a surface target is specified, two new markers are placed in observer
table output.  They indicate if the target point on the surface is lit by the
Sun and if it is on the near or far-side of the target body relative to the
observer.</p>

<p>Altered descriptions are printed at the end of the output ephemeris tables
as warranted to describe the output.</p>

<h3 id="small-bodies">Small Bodies</h3>

<p>To select an asteroid or comet, enter one or more parameters to search on,
separated by a semi-colon, “;”.</p>

<p>Type <code>SB</code> for a list of 42 field keywords that can be used to search, or see
the list later in this document. Match symbols are from the set
{ <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;&gt;</code>, <code>=</code> }.</p>

<p>The most direct and unambiguous way to look up a small-body is to specify
its unique designation (and use a keyword to be sure). For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>DES= 1990 MU;</code></li>
  <li><code>DES= 2015 HM10;</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The keyword can typically be dropped and the designation alone entered,
along with a semi-colon:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>1990 MU;</code></li>
  <li><code>2015 HM10;</code></li>
</ul>

<p>… however, if the desired or unique response is not obtained, try the full
keyword specification using “DES=”. If the small-body has a permanent IAU ID
number, that can also be used for direct look-up without a keyword:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>1;</code>       (retrieves “1 Ceres”)</li>
  <li><code>433;</code>     (retrieves “433 Eros”)</li>
  <li><code>4179;</code>    (retrieves “4179 Toutatis”)</li>
</ul>

<p>Designation is only one of the small-body look-up keywords available, as
indicated by the ‘SB’ list mentioned above and discussed in more detail later
in this document.</p>

<p>For example,  “A &lt; 2.5; IN &gt; 7.8; STYP = S, GM &lt;&gt; 0; “ searches for all
S-type small-bodies with semi-major axis less than 2.5 au and inclination
greater than 7.8 degrees with a known (non-zero) GM.</p>

<p>Spaces in the look-up command are not considered, nor are upper/lower-case
distinctions. Exceptions are object names and designations. Name searches
consider spaces. Designation searches consider spaces AND upper/lower-case.</p>

<p>If you want to match a fragment of a name or designation, end it with an
asterisk (*). For example, DES = 1993&amp;ast;). Otherwise, it is assumed a
complete name or designation is specified and the search must match exactly
and completely.</p>

<p>The ‘*’ symbol is NOT a positional wildcard match but only a switch that
activates matching on the preceding sub-string. Horizons searches do not support
UNIX regular expressions or pattern matching syntax.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>NAME = CERES;</code>    (matches only if object name is “Ceres”)</li>
  <li><code>NAME = CER*;</code>     (match “Ceres”, “Lucerna”, “Cicero”, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The same keyword can be used more than once in a search command.</p>

<p>For example, <code>IN &gt;10; IN &lt; 20;</code> will list those objects possessing an
inclination between 10 and 20 degrees. If the directive <code>LIST;</code> is in the search
request, the matched parameters will be displayed. For example, <code>IN &gt; 150; LIST</code>
will display the inclination of each object with inclination greater than 150
degrees.</p>

<p>Once a small-body is uniquely identified, a screen of data will be displayed.
This data display shows the parameters retrieved from the JPL small-body
database and are what will be used in subsequent ephemeris calculations (unlike
the situation with major bodies, whose confirmation screen values are drawn
from published literature for information purposes only and generally will not
be used in subsequent calculations).</p>

<p>If more than one small-body matches the parameters, a list of matching objects
is instead displayed.  Individual objects from the matched list can then be
requested by giving the displayed “record number”, followed by a semi-colon.
This record number is not necessarily permanent and is valid only for the
immediately prior search.</p>

<p>The semi-colon is used to indicate a small-body request and resolve
number ambiguities. For example, entering ‘1’ will select Mercury Barycenter.
Enter ‘1;’ to retrieve the small-body in record 1 (Ceres).</p>

<p>Osculating elements for more than one comet apparition may be listed
(“apparition” refers to a particular perihelion passage), since out-gassing
near perihelion can alter the orbit for each passage.  Select an apparition
from the list with the closest epoch prior to the date of interest for the
ephemeris, or add the “CAP” directive to the search to automatically select
the closest apparition of interest:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>CAP;</code>         (return last apparition before current date)</li>
  <li><code>CAP &lt; JD#;</code>   (return last apparition before specified Julian Day Number)</li>
  <li><code>CAP &lt; YEAR;</code>  (return last apparition before given integer year)</li>
</ul>

<p>If the number after a <code>&lt;</code> in a <code>CAP;</code> specification is less than 10000, it is
interpreted as a year integer. Otherwise, the number is taken to be a Julian
Day Number. If <code>CAP;</code> is specified, the search is automatically recognized as
being a comets-only search.</p>

<p>The record (or file) number of unnumbered asteroids and comet apparitions should
<strong>NOT</strong> be considered constants; they <strong>WILL</strong> change as the database is updated.</p>

<p>To enter your own heliocentric ecliptic elements, type <code>;</code> within the
command-line interface. This capability is described in more detail in a later
section. Web-interface, API, and e-mail interfaces have settings or menus
to specify user-input objects.</p>

<p>Example queries follow. Where more than one example is given, the first is
most likely to complete as intended.</p>

<p>For example, <code>ASTNAM = Vesta;</code> will always return the asteroid. However, if you
use the convenient form <code>Vesta</code>, which is allowed, it is possible that a future
natural satellite or spacecraft name will someday include that string and there
will no longer be a unique match. A good habit might be to include at least one
semi-colon in all small-body searches so as to be unambiguous.</p>

<p>Search for objects matching a set of parameters:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; A &lt; 2.5; IN &gt; 7.8; STYP = S; GM &lt;&gt; 0;</code>       (asteroid &amp; comets)</li>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; A &lt; 2.5; IN &gt; 7.8; STYP = S; GM &lt;&gt; 0; AST;</code>  (asteroids only)</li>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; A &lt; 2.5; IN &gt; 7.8; STYP = S; GM &lt;&gt; 0; COM;</code>  (comets only)</li>
</ul>

<p>Match by name:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; ASTNAM= Vesta;</code></li>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; Vesta;</code></li>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; Vesta</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Match by name fragment:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; NAME= mua*;</code>  (Objects with names containing ‘mua’)</li>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; mua*;</code></li>
</ul>

<p>“Wildcard” match designation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; DES = 1993*;</code> (Objects with designations containing 1993)</li>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; 1993*;</code></li>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; 1993*</code></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: The <code>*</code> must be at the end and is <strong>NOT</strong> a true positional wildcard.
        It instead toggles searches on sub-strings of characters. For example,
        <code>19*3;</code> is not a recognized search.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Match exact designation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; DES= 1990 MU;</code></li>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; 1990 MU;</code></li>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; 1990 MU</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Select numbered asteroid:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; 1;</code>  (Object in database record #1, “1 Ceres”)</li>
</ul>

<p>Define an arbitrary object not in database</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; ;</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Comet searches:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; COMNAM= HER*;</code>         (Comet names (only) containing “her”)</li>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; DES= 73P;</code>             (Request comet 73P apparitions, including
                                  fragments, if any)</li>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; DES= 73P; NOFRAG</code>      (Request apparitions of comet 73P,
                                   excluding fragments)</li>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; DES= 73P; CAP</code>         (Request comet 73P apparition solution
                                   closest to present date, including any
                                  fragments)</li>
  <li><code>Horizons&gt; DES= 73P; NOFRAG; CAP</code> (Request comet 73P apparition solution
                                   closest to present date, excluding any

  <li><code>Horizons&gt; COM; NOFRAG; CAP</code>      (List the apparition solutions closest to
                                   to the present date for all comets,

</ul>

<h2 id="a-idspacecraft-classanchor-under-tabaspacecraft-trajectories-in-horizons"><a id="spacecraft" class="anchor-under-tab"></a>Spacecraft Trajectories in Horizons</h2>

<p>Horizons was generally intended to make the natural-body dynamics work of the
JPL Solar System Dynamics Group accessible to astronomers and mission planners.
However, it is often convenient to make spacecraft trajectory information
available through the same mechanism, especially for use by space-based
telescopes as observing sites.</p>

<p>Sources of the spacecraft trajectory data in Horizons include navigation teams
at JPL, flight projects at other NASA centers, ESA, as well as TLE-based
orbits from the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC). Trajectories provided
by navigation teams reflect the full dynamical model, including thruster
firings, solar pressure, extended spherical harmonic gravity fields,
atmospheric drag, and whatever other dynamic model is used for navigation.</p>

<p>While Horizons will always have the latest comet, asteroid, planet, and natural
satellite solutions, keeping current with the externally produced spacecraft
trajectories is problematic; there is no mandate or funding or staff for this,
and maneuvers and mission planning changes can occur without notification,
making a trajectory obsolete after some point in time.</p>

<p>Some flight projects do set up a regular delivery schedule to keep Horizons
current (some mission science teams use Horizons for planning). More typically,
a spacecraft is added if its inclusion is requested by a researcher with a
specific need.</p>

<p>A flight project might provide an initial planning trajectory prior to launch
and a final historical trajectory after end of mission. This is often sufficient
for spacecraft in interplanetary trajectory phases, since the spacecraft are
maneuvered to maintain such reference trajectories, which are often designed
years in advance.</p>

<p>However, spacecraft trajectories can get orphaned in Horizons if updates
stop happening. Always check the revision date in the upper left corner of
the Horizons spacecraft data-sheet to determine the last time the spacecrafts’
trajectory was updated, and read the data-sheet comments for mission status
information.</p>

<p>Spacecraft in low Earth orbit in particular (such as ISS, HST, Swift, GALEX)
need frequent updates to maintain high accuracy. Predictions more than a few
days into the future can have 10s or 100’s of km of error, especially since
maneuvers are not anticipated in the TLE-based predicts. Users can input their
own TLEs to define an artificial satellite and propagate its trajectory, as
described elswehere in this documentation.</p>

<p>For interplanetary missions, users having high-precision applications (such as
mission data reduction) should contact JPL Solar System Dynamics to verify the
status of the specific trajectory in Horizons if there is doubt as to the
available trajectorys’ revision status:</p>

<p><a href="mailto:Jon.D.Giorgini@jpl.nasa.gov">Jon.D.Giorgini@jpl.nasa.gov</a>   (SSDG analyst)</p>

<p>Some archival mission trajectories are available. These spacecraft trajectories
are often expressed relative to older, target-body trajectories such that
multi-km offsets can appear if output is instead requested relative to a modern
target-body trajectory. This is because the modern solutions are derived from
different measurement datasets and dynamical models (planetary ephemerides),
introducing inconsistencies.</p>

<p>To avoid this, Horizons usually includes the original mission-target ephemeris
to permit consistent reconstruction with the archived spacecraft trajectory.</p>

<p>For example, the NEAR spacecraft trajectory during the Eros mapping phase was
expressed relative to the asteroid Eros within the dynamical system of the
DE200 planetary ephemeris, and has not been updated, while Eros’ trajectory is
now expressed in Horizons relative to the Sun in the system of the DE441
planetary ephemeris.</p>

<p>To obtain the historically accurate position of NEAR with respect to Eros
as it was during the mission, select the archived Eros trajectory along with
the archived NEAR trajectory. How to do this is explained in the Horizons
data-sheet for NEAR, but amounts to specifying the SPK ID of the archived
target body instead of integrating it from the database of orbital elements.</p>

<p>For example, to obtain ….</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>NEAR wrt historical Eros orbit solution (#80):</p>

    <p>Specify target as <code>NEAR</code> with observing center <code>@ 2000433</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>NEAR wrt current Eros orbit solution:
Not available</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eros historical orbit solution (#80) wrt to NEAR:</p>

    <p>Specify target as <code>2000433</code> with observing center <code>@ NEAR</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eros current orbit solution wrt NEAR (offset wrt to historical):</p>

    <p>Specify target as <code>Eros;</code> or <code>2000433;</code>, observing center <code>@ NEAR</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-idcenter-classanchor-under-tabacoordinate-center-observing-site-selection"><a id="center" class="anchor-under-tab"></a>Coordinate Center (Observing Site) Selection</h2>

<p>Once a target is specified, the next step is to specify the origin of the
coordinate system, or the “observing point”, relative to which the ephemeris
output quantities should be expressed.</p>

<p>While osculating element tables may be generated with respect to a major body
center only, vector and observer tables may produce output with respect to an
arbitrary observing site defined with respect to a major body center.</p>

<h3 id="earth-sites">Earth Sites</h3>

<p>For the Earth, a list with the locations of 2300+ sites is predefined. The
list generally matches that of the Minor Planet Center while providing an
expanded list of radar/radio sites (which have negative ID numbers). Station
<code>500</code> is the geocenter.</p>

<h3 id="non-earth-sites">Non-Earth Sites</h3>

<p>For non-Earth major bodies, station 500 also represents the body center.
For those major bodies with IAU rotational models, additional topocentric sites
may be defined. Spacecraft landing sites are typically predefined on non-Earth
bodies.</p>

<h3 id="specifying-a-predefined-observing-site">Specifying a Predefined Observing Site</h3>

<p>There are several equivalent ways of specifying an observing location. The
most general form that always works is …</p>

<p><code>site @ body</code></p>

<p>… where “site” is a numeric code or name fragment of an observatory to match,
and “body” is a numeric major body code or name fragment to match.</p>

<p>A list of such major body codes follows later in this document, or type <code>MB</code> at
the main Horizons prompt in the command-line interface, or send “COMMAND= MB”
via API or e-mail interfaces. For the web interface, see
<a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/time_spans.html">https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/time_spans.html</a></p>

<p>Here are four equivalent ways of searching for and specifying the same Earth
site location:</p>

<pre>
    Code         Meaning
    -----------  -------------------------------------------------------------
    675@399      Site #675 on Earth (Palomar Mountain)
    palomar@399         "
    675@                "
    Palomar             "           (observer table only)
</pre>

<h4 id="observer--vector-tables">Observer &amp; Vector Tables</h4>

<p>If an observer or vector table has been requested, the <code>@</code> symbol may be
dropped; the Earth will be assumed if only an integer like <code>675</code> or a name
fragment like <code>Palom</code> is input.</p>

<p>However, if you are trying to specify an observing site not on Earth, you MUST
use the <code>@</code> symbol for correct interpretation. For example, if an observer table
as seen from the Sun is desired, it must be specified as <code>@10</code> or <code>@sun</code>.
Specifying <code>10</code> only will select the Caussols site.</p>

<h4 id="element-tables">Element Tables</h4>

<p>For an osculating element table, the different assumption (for abbreviated
input of specified center) is made that a coordinate center request lacking
a <code>@</code> symbol is a major body. For example, <code>10</code> would mean the Caussols site
for an observer or vector table, but <code>Sun</code> for a vector table.  <code>10@</code> or
<code>10@399</code> would mean the Caussols site for both table types.</p>

<p>The different assumptions are meant to be efficient for the particular types of
output requested, expediting “typical” usage, especially in the  command-line
interface. However, the full form <code>site @ body</code> can always be used to avoid
having to remember “quirks”.</p>

<p>If your specification returns more than one possible match, the list of
matched sites is returned. Refine your site request to be more specific, by
using the unique numeric codes listed for example, and try again.</p>

<p>While one can spell out the names of the bodies and sites, it is possible
unique matches won’t be returned. Thus, use the unique ID numbers when known.</p>

<p>For example, <code>675 @ Earth</code> will first look for the body, match both the Earth &amp;
Earth-Moon barycenter, thus have to quit before finding specific Palomar site
coordinates. <code>675 @ 399</code> is unique and avoids this problem. Spaces &amp; upper/lower
case are ignored.</p>

<h3 id="user-defined-topocentric-site-coordinates">User-Defined Topocentric Site Coordinates</h3>

<p>Many small or recently discovered natural satellites do not have defined
rotation models, thus do not support topocentric site definition. Only
body-centered observers can be defined.</p>

<p>However, for sites with rotation models, topocentric sites may be input by the
user as follows (command-line interface only; API, web, and e-mail specify
with query settings or filling in boxes):</p>

<pre>
    Code         Meaning
    ------------ -------------------------------------------------------------
     c @ Europa  Request prompting for user location on satellite Europa
    coord @ 502  (same thing)
</pre>

<p>After coordinate input is requested, the site location may be entered
as either geodetic or cylindrical coordinate triplets, separated by commas:</p>

<pre>
    GEODETIC (generally this means map coordinates)
        E-long - Geodetic east longitude (DEGREES)
        lat    - Geodetic latitude  (DEGREES)
        h      - Altitude above reference ellipsoid (km)

    CYLINDRICAL
        E-long - Angle eastward from XZ plane      (DEGREES)
        DXY    - Distance from Z axis              (KM)
        DZ     - Height above XY equator plane     (KM)
</pre>

<p>For Earth, observing site coordinates should be specified relative to the ITRF93
(or WGS-84 GPS) reference ellipsoid. The two systems differ by about 0.1 meters,
but are currently treated as interchangeable in Horizons.</p>

<p>Altitude specifications should be with respect to the reference ellipsoid,
not “mean sea level”. There can be more than 100 meters of difference between
MSL and ellipsoid altitudes of a site. Separate on-line tools can help convert
from MSL to ellipsoid altitude:</p>

<p>https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/cgi-bin/GeoidEval</p>

<p>For other bodies, Horizons uses planetodetic/geodetic IAU coordinates (or
mean Earth of DE421 for the Moon). This is typically the one used on maps, such
as those by the USGS, unless the map says otherwise. In these coordinates, the
rotational pole of the body that lies on the positive (north) side of the
invariable plane of the solar system (the plane perpendicular to the solar
systems’ angular momentum vector) is called the “north pole”.</p>

<p>Northern latitudes are positive, southern are negative. The planetodetic
latitude takes into account body oblateness and, for a point on the surface,
is the angle between the body equatorial plane and the normal to the reference
surface at that point. For a point not on the reference surface, the geodetic
latitude is the latitude of the point on the reference surface where the normal
passes through the point at some altitude (h) above the reference surface.</p>

<p>Prograde (or direct) rotation of a body is rotation eastward, or counter-
clockwise, as seen from the north pole. For such bodies (with the exception
of the Earth, Moon, and Sun discussed next), positive longitude values are taken
to mean west and so the equivalent longitude eastward is specified negatively
from the prime meridian (i.e.,  west-longitude - 360). For example, if you have
a site on Mars at 12 degrees west, and Horizons asks you to enter the eastward
longitude, enter -348 degrees. The negative sign is used in place of an “E”
symbol to ensure proper input.</p>

<p>Exceptions are the Earth, Moon and Sun, where longitude has historically
been measured both east and west of the prime meridian. Though these bodies are
direct rotators, positive longitude values are assumed to be eastward in this
system due to historical precedence.</p>

<p>If starting with the positive west-longitude of an observing site on Earth,
Moon, or Sun, it should be input here as an equivalent positive east-longitude,
which would be (360 - given west-longitude).  For example, if a site is at 23
degrees west on Earth, and Horizons asks you to specify the east-longitude
(as it will), enter 337 degrees.</p>

<p>If a negative “east-longitude” value (“meaning westward”) is instead available
for a location on these three bodies, one can input the negative value. However,
it will be converted to a positive east-longitude on output, as (360 + value).
For example, if Horizons asks for the east-longitude of an observing site on
Earth and a “-5” is entered, it will be taken to mean the equivalent 355 degrees
east-longitude.</p>

<p>Retrograde rotation is rotation westward, or clockwise as seen from the north
pole. Positive numeric longitudes for these bodies are taken to mean “eastward
from the prime meridian” in Horizons. If you are given a west-longitude for a
site on a retrograde rotator, specify its equivalent longitude eastward to
Horizons as (360 - west longitude). For example, if given a site on Venus at
78 degrees west, specify the eastward longitude to Horizons as 282 degrees.</p>

<p>The following major bodies are either retrograde or exceptions and require
site input with positive east-longitude:</p>

<pre>
    Retrograde (+ east-longitude):
    ------------------------------
       Venus (299), Arial (701), Umbriel (702), Titania (703),
       Oberon (704), Miranda (705), Cordelia (706), Ophelia (707),
       Bianca (708), Cressida (709), Desdemona (710), Juliet (711),
       Portia (712), Rosalind (713), Belinda (714), Puck (715),
       Uranus (799), Triton (801)

    Also + east-longitude (prograde exceptions):
    --------------------------------------------
       Sun (10), Earth (399), Moon (301)
</pre>

<p>The other major bodies are prograde rotators and must be input with negative
longitudes, indicating eastward relative to the prime meridian. Since such sites
are usually expressed in terms of positive west-longitude on maps, the
equivalent east-negative value would be (west-longitude - 360), as described
above.</p>

<p>To verify proper interpretation, check the ephemeris output header which reports
the user-input site coordinates used in the body’s native system.</p>

<h3 id="interpreting-non-earth-observer-tables">Interpreting non-Earth Observer Tables</h3>

<p>When selecting a site on a body other than the Earth, some definitions
and quantities slightly shift in meaning:</p>

<h4 id="visually-interfering-body">Visually interfering body</h4>

<p>The largest other body in the system. Such a body may visually complicate
observations at the site due to its brightness or by covering up the target.
On the Earth, the “interfering body” is the Moon. On Io, it would be Jupiter.
On Mars, it would be Phobos (largest body, though unlikely to genuinely
interfere).  Mercury and Venus have no interfering bodies.</p>

<p>Observer tables provide some optional quantities that can be used to
characterize the effect of the interfering body (or IB): how far is the target
from the IB in the plane-of-sky, is it obscured by the IB, what fraction of the
IB is lit by the Sun as seen from the observing site, and so on.</p>

<p>For observation points located on Earth, the estimated visual signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) of the target relative to atmosphere-scattered moonlight is
available as an optional output.</p>

<h4 id="deflecting-body-1">Deflecting body</h4>

<p>Currently, only the Sun’s mass is used to compute the relativistic deflection
 of light that can change the apparent position of the target body.</p>

<h4 id="other-changes">Other changes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>REFRACTION</p>

    <p>No refraction effects are modeled for non-Earth sites. Any request
for refraction is ignored and the refraction angle will be zero. This
applies to rise-set determinations on non-Earth bodies as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AIRMASS</p>

    <p>There is no airmass model or airmass cut-off available for non-Earth
sites. Any request for airmass computation is ignored, and output as
“n.a.” (not available).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>APPARENT RA &amp; DEC</p>

    <p>The origin of right-ascension for apparent coordinates on NON-EARTH sites
with rotational models is the meridian containing the ICRF +x-axis. Apparent
declination is with respect to the particular body’s true equator-of-date.
This allows an observer to align axes with the pole and use the angle output
as “local apparent sidereal time” output by this system to set the RA origin
and acquire the target.</p>

    <p>For objects lacking a pole &amp; prime meridian rotational model (spacecraft
and certain asteroids that may have been redefined as “major bodies”), the
inertial reference frame (ICRF or FK4/B1950) coordinate system is used
to compute apparent places.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TIME</p>

    <p>Time tags refer to the time-scale conversion from TDB on Earth regardless
of observer location within the solar system, although clock rates may differ
due to the local gravity field and no analogous time-scales are locally
defined.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="limitations-of-non-earthmoon-rotation-models">Limitations of non-Earth/Moon Rotation Models</h3>

<p>For bodies other than the Earth and Moon, precession and nutation effects are
not usually known to high accuracy. The IAU rotation and cartographic models
used to determine surface sites may be accurate at only the ~0.1 degree or
greater level in the present era for such cases.</p>

<p>For the gas giants Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, IAU longitude is
based on the “Set III” prime meridian rotation angle of the magnetic field.
By contrast, pole direction (thus latitude) is relative to the body dynamical
equator. There can be an offset between the magnetic pole and the dynamical
pole of rotation.</p>

<p>For many satellites, the official pole direction adopted for the IAU model was
simply assumed perpendicular to the body’s mean orbit plane, lacking better
information. For many satellites in the IAU model, the rotation rate was
assumed equal to the mean orbital period.</p>

<p>Some small satellite rotational models are strictly valid only at the time
of the Voyager spacecraft flyby; extrapolation to other times is problematic.
Topocentric results for such bodies (610-614, for example) should be used
cautiously if at all. Results in these cases reflect only the best available
model, which is known to be deficient.</p>

<p>As rotation models are refined through observation of surface features by
visiting spacecraft (Cassini, etc.), Horizons will be updated to use the best
generally sanctioned models available.</p>

<h2 id="a-idsaving-classanchor-under-tabasaving-program-settings-command-line-interface-only"><a id="saving" class="anchor-under-tab"></a>Saving Program Settings (command-line interface only)</h2>

<p>Command-line interactive users may go through program options once, then save
all settings for recall during future sessions. This can save time, if you find
yourself always changing certain defaults or routinely defining the same output
format each time you connect. Others in your organization may load and use the
same pre-defined format settings by name.</p>

<p>To save program settings, go through the prompts and define the settings as
you require. Then return to the main “Horizons&gt;” prompt.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Type <code>SAVE {NAME}</code>, where <code>{NAME}</code> contains 1-12 characters.</li>
  <li>Input a password that allows you to later DELETE or REPLACE the macro</li>
  <li>Next time you telnet to Horizons, type <code>LOAD {NAME}</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your output preferences will then be loaded in as the new defaults.</p>

<p>If you make a mistake or want to change a setting later, two commands are
relevant: <code>DELETE</code> and <code>SAVE</code></p>

<p>DELETE a macro with command <code>DELETE {NAME}</code>. Alternatively, change specific
settings manually, then replace the stored  macro with a SAVE to an existing
name.  Delete and replace operations require input of a confirming password.
LOAD does not. Thus, anyone can use your settings if they know the macro name.
Only those who know the password can change or delete a macro.</p>

<p>Start/stop dates are also saved in the macro, as is observing location.
You need only load the macro and select the target. Remaining defaults will be
as defined in the format macro. If the macro is for an individual (personal
use), you may want to set the e-mail address prior to saving. Otherwise don’t,
so users of the macro will be prompted for it in the future.</p>

<p>A macro may be loaded, then specific settings overruled by responding to the
program prompts.  For example, if your last table prior to saving the macro was
a “vector” table, that table type will be saved as the default.</p>

<p>Settings for the other table types are saved as well so, to access them,
manually respond to the prompt requesting table type, over-riding the macros’
“vector” default on that issue.  Start and stop times are also macro settings
that may commonly be overruled as necessary.</p>

<p>Ideally, macro names would be something memorable:</p>

<p>“OBS670-1” for macro #1 for Observatory Code 670, etc.</p>

<p>… but the name is up to you.</p>

<p>The use of macros may make it less likely to stumble upon new capabilities
as they are added, though they will described here and in the system news,
as appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="a-idintdisp-classanchor-under-tabaintegrator-display-command-line-interface-only"><a id="intdisp" class="anchor-under-tab"></a>Integrator Display (command-line interface only)</h2>

<p>Comet and asteroid ephemerides are integrated from initial conditions
called “osculating elements”. These describe the 3-dimensional position and
velocity of the body at a specific time. The integrator starts with this state
and takes small time steps, summing the perturbing forces at each step and
assessing error before taking another step. A variable order, variable step-size
integrator is used to control error growth. In this way, the gravitational
attraction of other major solar system bodies on the target body trajectory is
taken into account.</p>

<p>The integrator starts at the epoch, or time, of the osculating elements.
It then integrates forward or backward, as necessary, to the start of the
requested table. Once it reaches the table start time, it may have to reverse
direction and go forward in time to generate the table.</p>

<p>Every 50th step will be displayed so the user can get some sense of the
progress of the ephemeris. Direction reversals are also displayed. If output
is requested at small time intervals, the integrator may proceed rapidly to
the start of the table. There may then be long (apparent) pauses, as numerous
interpolations within a given integration step are performed to compute states
at closely spaced print times.</p>

<p>The last number on the integrator display line is the most recent step
size in days.</p>

<h2 id="a-idtime-classanchor-under-tabaspecification-of-time"><a id="time" class="anchor-under-tab"></a>Specification of Time</h2>

<p>Time may be specified many ways in addition to the primary form
<code>YYYY-MMM-DD HH:MM:SS.fff</code>.  Of particular note are Julian Day Number and
day-of-yearforms.  Examples are shown below.  Input start times may be
specified to 1/1000th of a second if the default output setting is changed
from “minutes”.</p>

<p>Generally, if the input start time has more digits of precision specified
than the selected output format, start time will be truncated to the
appropriate level. For example, if a start time of 23:45:12.4 is specified, but
the output format is only set to minutes, start time will automatically be
changed to 23:45(:00.000).</p>

<p>The program will interpret other forms as well, but if you get too casual,
you may end up with a surprise interpretation.</p>

<p>The program’s time-span prompts indicate the earliest &amp; latest dates that
may be used for the selected target/center combination, as well as the timescale
assumed being input (UT, TDB, or TT). For API or browser interfaces, see
<a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/time_spans.html">https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/time_spans.html</a></p>

<p>For observer tables, output may be in either UT or TT timescale. For vector
tables, any of three scales may be used (TDB, TT, UT). For osculating element
tables, only the TDB timescale may be used.</p>

<p>To change the UT default for observer tables, append a “TT” when entering
START time. To switch back, append a “UT” to the start time.</p>

<p>The three time systems are described as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>TDB</strong>  (“Barycentric Dynamical Time”); typically for cartesian, osculating
         element, and close-approach tables. A uniform relativistic timescale
         and independent variable of the planetary ephemeris dynamical
         equations of motion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>TT</strong>   (“Terrestrial Time”), called TDT prior to 1991, used for observer
         quantity tables. This is proper time as measured by an Earth-bound
         observer and is directly related to atomic time, TAI. TT periodically
         differs from TDB by, at most, 0.002 seconds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>UT</strong>   is Universal Time. This can mean one of two non-uniform time-scales
         based on the rotation of the Earth. For this program, prior to 1962,
         UT means UT1.  After 1962, UT means UTC or “Coordinated Universal
         Time”. Future UTC leap-seconds are not known yet, so the closest
         known leap-second correction is used over future time-spans.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="time-zone-corrections">Time Zone Corrections</h3>

<p>Output time-tags may also be in local civil time. When specifying start time,
enter your time-zone correction in the format:</p>

<p><code>YYYY-Mon-Dy HH:MM UT{s}HH{:MM}</code></p>

<p>… where</p>

<pre>
      {s} ...  optional sign (+ or -). If unspecified, it is assumed "+".
      HH  ...  integer hours time-zone difference from UT
    {:MM} ...  optional minutes offset (usually 0)
</pre>

<p>North American standard time (winter) zone corrections are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Atlantic Standard Time (AST) =  UT-4 hours</li>
  <li>Eastern Standard Time  (EST) =  UT-5 hours</li>
  <li>Central Standard Time  (CST) =  UT-6 hours</li>
  <li>Mountain Standard Time (MST) =  UT-7 hours</li>
  <li>Pacific Standard Time  (PST) =  UT-8 hours</li>
</ul>

<p>If daylight savings is in effect (summer), add one hour to the above negative
offsets.</p>

<p>For example, <code>1999-Jun-2 12:30 UT-8</code> produces a table in Pacific Standard
Time. A <code>-7</code> would provide Pacific Daylight Time (or MST, if it is winter).</p>

<h3 id="gregorian-and-julian-calendar-dates">Gregorian and Julian Calendar Dates</h3>

<p>Calendar dates input by users and output by the program can be set to either
use the modern Gregorian calendar only, or a mixed calendar that automatically
switches between the historical Julian and modern Gregorian calendars.</p>

<p>The Julian calendar was adopted on January 1, 45 BC. It was widely used until
Oct 5, 1582, when the new Gregorian calendar began with Oct 15, 1582. The ten
skipped calendar day labels restored correspondence with Earth seasons that
had gradually drifted due to accumulated error in the Julian calendar.</p>

<p>Since the modern Gregorian calendar more accurately corresponds to physical
Earth seasons and orbital motion, it is an appropriate calendar to use when
analyzing such dynamical events as solstices and equinoxes.</p>

<p>However, historical events prior to 1582 are most likely recorded with the
Julian calendar in use at that time.</p>

<p>If the mixed calendar mode option is active, input calendar dates 1582-Oct-15
and after are assumed to be in the Gregorian calendar system. Prior dates are
assumed to be in the Julian calendar (which for earlier ancient dates is
extended even prior to its 45 BC adoption).</p>

<p>Historically, not all regions switched between Julian and Gregorian calendars
in 1582, or even in the same century. Thus, the user must be aware of which
calendar was in effect for a particular historical record. It should <em>NOT</em> be
assumed this systems’ calendar automatically correlates with a date from an
arbitrary historical document.</p>

<p>Here is the progression near the Julian/Gregorian calendar switch point in
mixed mode:</p>

<p>Note that “Julian dates” refer to the Julian calendar. By contrast, “Julian Day
Numbers” are a different concept, a uniform counting of days that is
calendar-independent aside from the count beginning at Noon mean solar time
on January 1st, 4713 B.C. in the proleptic Julian calendar.</p>

<p>Examination of the above table shows that the date labels from Oct 5, 1582
through Oct 14, 1582 don’t exist when transitioning between calendars.
Of course, the days themselves do, as is shown in the continuous Julian Day
Number column; it is just a matter of what they are labeled.</p>

<p>If you specify a non-existent calendarlabel that was “skipped”, this program
will automatically use a day number that maps into the previous Julian calendar
system, as shown above in the right-hand column. For example, requesting a date
of 1582-Oct-14 (skipped) is the same as requesting the Julian calendar date
1582-Oct-04.</p>

<h4 id="ancient-dates">Ancient Dates</h4>

<p>Objects 0-10, 199, 299, 301, and 399 (planet barycenters, their equivalents
and the Sun &amp; Moon) are available over a 9999 B.C. to A.D. 9999 interval. When
specifying ancient calendar dates, this system requires input in the “BC/AD”
system.  If no <code>BC</code> marker is input with a calendar date, it is assumed to be
<code>AD</code>.  Exceptions are AD years less than 100 which must have an AD symbol in
the date in order to be recognized as a valid year. For example, <code>66ad-jan-27</code>
will be accepted, but <code>66-Jan-27</code> cannot be parsed.</p>

<p>In this system, there are no negative years. The progression is as follows:</p>

<pre>
    Julian Day Number       Labeling-convention
      (Jan 1 00:00)       BC/AD      Arithmetical
    -----------------     -----      ------------
        1720327.5          3bc           -2
        1720692.5          2bc           -1
        1721057.5          1bc            0
        1721423.5          1ad            1
        1721788.5          2ad            2
</pre>

<p>From this, one can see that no days (in the arithmetical year “0”, for
example) are skipped in the BC/AD scheme, but they do have a different label
than in the corresponding arithmetical system.</p>

<p>Output observer-table lines begin with a ‘b’ in column 1, to indicate B.C.
dates, and a space (“ “) to indicate A.D. dates.</p>

<h3 id="output-stepping">Output Stepping</h3>

<p>There are three different ways of specifying when observer-table output should
be generated</p>

<h4 id="fixed-time-steps">1. Fixed time steps</h4>

<p>Output time steps are specified as integers with some associated units
from the set {days, hours, minutes}. Example responses to the prompt include
“30 days”, “1 day”, “10 min”, and so on.  To get half day steps, specify
“12 hour”.</p>

<p>It is possible to obtain output at less than 1 minute intervals. After
specifying a start and stop time, give a positive integer as the “time-step”,
without giving units, such as “10”.  This will divide the time span into
10 parts. For example, if start and stop times are one hour (3600 seconds)
apart, specifying a step of “240” will produce output every 15 seconds
(3600/15 = 240 intervals). “3600” will produce output every second.</p>

<p>Rise/set and satellite eclipse circumstances may not be accurate to less
than a minute since factors such as the primarys’ oblateness and atmosphere
are not currently modelled.</p>

<h4 id="calendar-steps">2. Calendar steps:</h4>

<p>If a step-size in units of “years” or “months” is specified, output steps
will follow the calendar based on the starting date.</p>

<p>For example, if the start is 2008-Feb-29, and output is requested at
“1 year” steps, output will be returned only for Feb 29 calendar days in those
leap years having 29 days in Februrary.</p>

<p>If output is requested at “1 month” intervals, output will occur for every
successive month on the 29th of that month.  If a start date on the 31st is
requested, output will only occur for months having 31 days.</p>

<h4 id="time-varying-angular-shift-steps">3. Time-varying angular-shift steps:</h4>

<p>Output is typically at fixed time intervals. However, observer tables may
additionally be requested at time-varying steps based on an angular shift
specification. That is, “output only if the object has moved at least X
arcseconds in the plane-of-sky”.</p>

<p>When specifying step-size, with the command-line or e-mail interfaces, respond
with something like <code>VAR ####</code>, where <code>####</code> is an integer from 60 to 3600
arcseconds. This will trigger output whenever the objects’ position is
predicted to be <code>####</code> arcseconds different from the current output step
in the observers’ plane-of-sky.</p>

<p>To preserve system performance, the time-varying output mode uses a
simple linear extrapolation to predict the time when the object should have
moved the requested distance.  Due to non-linearities in the objects’ actual
motion in the plane-of-sky, this projection can be off by .1 to 5 (or more)
arcsecs. Thus the angular-motion print criteria you give should be considered
approximate.</p>

<p>Computed quantities will be exact for the given time in the output, but
the particular output time may not be exactly that required for the requested
angular change.</p>

<h2 id="a-idframes-classanchor-under-tabareference-frames"><a id="frames" class="anchor-under-tab"></a>Reference Frames</h2>

<p>Reference frames are used to describe the position and velocity of an object
in three-dimensional space. Horizons uses several references frames, depending
on the purpose and user-specification.</p>

<h3 id="international-celestial-reference-frame-icrf">International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF)</h3>

<p>The primary reference frame is the ICRF. It is based on thousands of remote
extragalactic radio sources (mostly quasars) to specify three fixed reference
directions: the ICRF pole direction (+Z) and right ascension origin (+X),
along with the orthogonal +Y direction.</p>

<p>The ICRF was constructed to closely align with the older FK5/J2000 dynamic
reference frame – within the uncertainties of that system – while replacing
dynamical definitions based on intersecting and moving planes with ones
based on the more precisely determined and fixed radio source positions.
The ICRF has no associated standard epoch and, while it was aligned closely
with the original FK5/J2000 equatorial system, is not itself equatorial,
just ICRF.</p>

<p>The JPL planetary ephemeris solution (currently DE440/441) is closely
aligned with the ICRF-3 realization, and is thought to differ by at most
0.0002 arcseconds, while the ICRF is thought to differ from the previous
FK5/J2000 dynamical system by at most 0.02 arcseconds.</p>

<p>All underlying calculations in Horizons are done in the reference frame of
the planetary ephemeris (DE440/441), taken to be indistinguishable from the
ICRF using currently available measurements. They are then transformed to
other frames if necessary for final output.</p>

<p>Other reference frames developed relative to the ICRF in Horizons include:</p>

<h3 id="earth-true-equator-and-equinox-of-date-tod">Earth true equator and equinox of date (TOD)</h3>

<p>This moving reference frame is defined by the Earth’s “true” pole at any
instant, which defines the +z-axis, and moves due to luni-solar precession
and nutation. The slowly changing intersection of the equator plane and
orbit plane at any instant defines an x-axis direction called the “equinox
of-date”.</p>

<p>Horizons currently uses the IAU76/80 precession-nutation theory, corrected
daily by GPS measurements over the modern era, to transform from ICRF to
the “true-of-date” reference frame. Due to different adopted ecliptics, the
origin of RA (x-axis) in this intermediate reference frame differs by
about -53 mas from the IAU2006/00A of-date system.</p>

<h3 id="international-terrestrial-reference-frame-itrf93">International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF93)</h3>

<p>This is the Earth body-frame to which Earth station coordinates are
referred, and is produced from the Earth TOD frame with additional small
GPS-derived polar motion corrections.</p>

<h3 id="lunar-mean-earth-frame-of-de421">Lunar Mean-Earth Frame of DE421</h3>

<p>Like the lower precision IAU lunar model, the mean Earth/polar axis model uses
a +Z axis aligned with the north mean lunar rotation axis, while the prime
meridian contains the mean Earth direction. This system is also sometimes called
the “mean Earth/mean rotation axis” system or just “mean Earth” system, and is
a rotation by a fixed offet from the DE440 principal axis (or PA) system
sometimes also used in lunar studies to the standard DE421 mean Earth frame.
The lunar PA frame is not currently available in Horizons.</p>

<p>The high precision lunar rotational-pole model is available only over the
timespan A.D. 1550 - 2650. Outside that span, Horizons will automatically
transition to use the low-precision IAU model. The models used are given
in the output header.</p>

<p>For example, output involving the lunar cartographic model over 1500-2700 would
contain the following summary line in the header:</p>

<pre>
  Target pole/equ : IAU_MOON, MOON_ME, IAU_MOON   {East-longitude positive}
</pre>

<p>… indicating output begins with the IAU_MOON model, transitions to MOON_ME
at 1550, then switches back to IAU_MOON after 2650.</p>

<p>If the output is entirely within the 1550-2650 interval of the high-precision
model (typical usage), the label would instead be:</p>

<pre>
  Target pole/equ : MOON_ME                       {East-longitude positive}
</pre>

<h3 id="body-equator-and-node-of-date">Body equator and node of date</h3>

<p>Rotational models for the planets, natural satellites, and some asteroids
are periodically published by the IAU Working Group on Cartographic
Coordinates and Rotational Elements. These specify body spin-pole direction
in ICRF coordinates. Body rotation is specified relative to the intersection
(node) of the body’s equator plane with the fixed ICRF fundamental plane,
which defines the x-axis for the reference frame.</p>

<p>This is analagous to (but different from) the equinox direction used for
Earth, whose of-date +x-axis is defined by intersection of an orbit and
equator.</p>

<p>Since some bodies have poles with fixed spin directions in the IAU system,
“of-date” body coordinates may actually refer to a fixed node direction.
Other bodies have moving poles such that the node reference direction can
shift over time.</p>

<h3 id="ecliptic-of-standard-epoch-j2000-or-b1950">Ecliptic of Standard Epoch (J2000 or B1950)</h3>

<p>This fixed reference frame was nominally based on an adopted model of the
Earth’s mean heliocentric orbit plane, but is now produced by rotating
around the ICRF x-axis by a standard fixed obliquity angle (epsilon) of
84381.448 arcseconds.</p>

<p>Asteroid and comet orbit solutions at JPL and elsewhere continue to store
and transfer solutions using this IAU76/86 standard ecliptic plane at the
J2000 epoch.</p>

<p>The ecliptic concept, being based on adopted definitions of a “mean orbit
plane”, is ambiguous at high-precision levels due to the mutual motion of
the Earth and Moon. Consistent usage is most important. If doing physics
such as orbit propagations at high precision levels in a different ecliptic
(not recommended), use the given epsilon to transform back to ICRF, then
into the desired ecliptic frame.</p>

<p>Given FK4/B1950 ecliptic output from Horizons, an obliquity epsilon of
84404.8362512 arc-seconds should be used to recover the original FK4/B1950
coordinates.</p>

<h3 id="fk4b1950">FK4/B1950</h3>

<p>This older dynamical reference frame option is based on the Earth
mean-equator and FK4 optical catalog equinox of the epoch B1950.0, the
Julian Day Number at the start of the Besselian year B1950.0
(2433282.42345905). The Fricke equinox correction at epoch is applied.
It can be described as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>xy-plane</strong>: plane of the Earth’s mean equator at the reference epoch
              (B1950.0)</li>
  <li><strong>x-axis</strong>  : out along ascending node of the instantaneous plane of the
              Earth’s orbit and the Earth’s mean equator at the reference
              epoch</li>
  <li><strong>z-axis</strong>  : along the Earth mean north pole at the reference epoch</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ecliptic-of-date">Ecliptic of date</h3>

<p>Used for some observer table quantities, this dynamic frame uses the
IAU76/80 time-varying Earth obliquity model to construct the ecliptic x-y
plane of-date over modern eras and the long-term IAU76/80-compatible model
of Owen, a long-term integration of Kinoshita’s polar equations of motion,
for times more than 200 years from the year 2000.</p>

<pre>
    Directive  Description
    ---------  -----------
    COM .....  Limit search to comets only

    AST .....  Limit search to asteroids only

    LIST ....  Display parameter values for matched objects. (This may be
                set as a default for all subsequent searches by typing "LIST"
                at the main system prompt, "Horizons&gt;".)

               For example,
                "A &lt; 2.5; IN &gt; 10; AST;"        (match parameters against
                                                 asteroids ONLY)
                "A &lt; 2.5; IN &gt; 10; AST; LIST;"  (match AND display values
                                                 of the parameters)

    NOFRAG ..  Exclude/skip comet fragments

    CAP .....  A filter that guarantees only one comet apparition will be
                returned for each comet. It may be used three ways:

                CAP;        (returns last apparition before the current date)
                CAP &lt; JD#;  (returns last apparition before the specified

               If the number after a '&lt;' is less than 10000, it is assumed
               to be a year integer. Otherwise, the number is taken to be
               a Julian Day Number.  If "CAP;" is specified, the search is
               automatically recognized as being a comets-only search.

<h3 id="contents-of-small-body-database--update-frequency">Contents of Small-body Database &amp; Update Frequency</h3>

<p>Excluded from the database are single opposition asteroids with observational
data arcs less than 30 days, unless they are NEOs, PHAs or radar targets (which
ARE included). Everything else is in.</p>

<p>Except for “PHAs” and NEOs, which are usually included within a couple
hours of announcement, there can be a delay of a few days to a couple weeks
before newly discovered objects (that meet the filter criteria) are added.
Users can input their own objects, as described in the next section. The
database is updated hourly with new objects and orbit solutions.</p>

<h2 id="a-iduser-classanchor-under-tabauser-specified-small-bodies"><a id="user" class="anchor-under-tab"></a>User-Specified Small-Bodies</h2>

<p>It is possible to define an object not in the database by manual input of
<strong>HELIOCENTRIC IAU76/J2000 ECLIPTIC</strong> elements and some other optional
parameters.  One could also display a database entry Horizons, then
“cut-and-paste” elements back into the program, varying parameters (such as
magnitude), as needed.  Cut-and-paste is a function of your local terminal
capability.</p>

<p>From the command-line interface, type ‘;’ at the main prompt.</p>

<p>Enter the required data as described below.
Press <code>return</code> on a blank line when done. Input format is:</p>

<pre>
    LABEL= VALUE LABEL= VALUE ...
    LABEL= VALUE ...
      .
      .
</pre>

<p>… where acceptable label strings are defined as follows:</p>

<pre>
    EPOCH ..  Julian Day Number of osculating elements (TDB timescale, JDTDB)
    EC .....  Eccentricity
    QR .....  Perihelion distance (au)
    TP .....  Perihelion Julian Day Number
    OM .....  Longitude of ascending node (DEGREES) wrt IAU76/80 ecliptic
    W ......  Argument of perihelion (DEGREES) with respect to IAU76/80 ecliptic
    IN .....  Inclination (DEGREES) with respect to IAU76/80 ecliptic
</pre>

<p>Instead of {<code>TP</code>, <code>QR</code>}, {<code>MA</code>, <code>A</code>} or {<code>MA</code>,<code>N</code>} may be specified (not both):</p>

<pre>
    MA .....  Mean anomaly (DEGREES)
    A ......  Semi-major axis (au)
    N ......  Mean motion (DEG/DAY)
</pre>

<p>Note that if you specify elements with <code>MA</code>, {<code>TP</code>, <code>QR</code>} will be computed from
them. The program always uses <code>TP</code> and <code>QR</code> internally.</p>

<h3 id="optional-inputs">Optional Inputs</h3>

<pre>
    RAD ......  Object radius (KM)
    AMRAT ....  Area-to-mass ratio (m^2/kg). Setting to a non-zero value
                 activates calculation of solar radiation pressure
                 acceleration. Total absorption is assumed, so scale the
                 value to account for reflectivity. For example, if 15%
                 of light is reflected, specify a value for AMRAT for
                 which the actual value is multiplied by 1.15.

<p>If {<code>R0</code>, <code>ALN</code>, <code>NM</code>, <code>NN</code>, <code>NK</code>} are not specified, but the non-gravitational
model is activated with a non-zero <code>A1</code>, <code>A2</code>, or <code>A3</code>, the default values
shown are assumed, as described in “Cometary Orbit Determination and
Nongravitational Forces”, in Comets II, University of Arizona Press (2004),
pp. 137-151. They specify a semi-empirical water-ice sublimation dynamical
model appropriate for the <em>COMETARY</em> <code>A1</code>, <code>A2</code>, and <code>A3</code> data-fit solutions
at JPL.</p>

<p>If <code>ALN= 1.0</code>, <code>NK= 0.0</code>, <code>NM= 2.0</code>, <code>NN= 5.093</code>, <code>R0= 1.0</code> are specified
instead, the A1-A3 scaling terms from the orbit solution indicate a
non-gravitational acceleration that goes as 1 au/r^2, where r is heliocentric
distance. This simple inverse square model is useful for modeling <em>ASTEROID</em>
solar radiation pressure (in the A1 radial component) and/or approximating
thermal re-radiation (Yarkovsky) and other cumulative accelerations in the
transverse A2 component.</p>

<p>For the <code>AMRAT</code> solar pressure model, total absorption is assumed. Scale the
value to account for reflectivity. For example, if 15% of light is reflected,
specify a value for <code>AMRAT</code> for which the actual value is multiplied by 1.15.</p>

<p>You may enter each value on a separate line or several on one line.  If you
make a mistake, re-entering the label on another line will over-write the
previously specified value.  To erase a value, enter something like <code>H=</code>,
where no value is given. To cancel all input, enter <code>-</code> as the first character
on a line. To log-out, enter a <code>q</code> or <code>x</code> as first character on a line.</p>

<p>When done, after having pressed <code>return</code> on a blank line, you will be
asked whether the reference frame of the elements is J2000/ICRF or FK4/B1950.0.
You will also be asked to supply a name for the object.</p>

<h2 id="a-idtles-classanchor-under-tabauser-specified-two-line-elements-tles"><a id="tles" class="anchor-under-tab"></a>User-Specified Two-Line Elements (TLEs)</h2>

<p>Geocentric SGP4/SDP4 Two-Line Element (TLE) format data can be specified by
users to define an Earth-orbiting artificial satellite. Such data is primarily
available from Space-Track.org and CelesTrak.com.</p>

<p>Horizons maintains trajectories for only a small subset of Earth-orbiting
satellites, so this user-input option allows specification of other objects
not in Horizons. These add-ins can then be used as targets (to observe) and
coordinate origins (observing sites from which to observe).</p>

<p>The standard TLE format can be cut-and-pasted into Horizons here. For example:</p>

<pre>

1 87820U 11053A   11273.79990913  .00099611  00000-0  64461-3 0  9991

</pre>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Press <code>return</code> on a blank line when done.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Type ‘-‘ alone on a line to abandon TLE input (discard)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first line can be the objects’ name (“SC-1”), as can every 3rd line.
Names are a maximum of 24 characters in length.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Name is optional, but if no name is provided, you will be prompted for
an optional name after TLE data input is complete.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Multiple TLE sets can be input, up to some system limit which may change
but is nominally 600 sets (1200 data lines … name lines are not counted)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Input TLEs can be extrapolated over a limited time-span before and after
the first and last TLE epochs. This limit may change, but is nominally
+/- 14 days. Extrapolation errors outside the TLE epoch bounds grow at
perhaps 1-3 km per day, but this is highly variable and could be much
worse if there is thruster activity. If there are large gaps in the data,
ephemeris results could be heavily degraded (i.e., worthless … passing
through the Earth, etc.).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The data does not have to be in chronological order, though that
would be a normal thing to do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once a TLE object has been defined, you can go off and do other things
in Horizons (when using it interactively via telnet), then come back
later and select the previously input dataset as a target by typing
“TLE” at the main Horizons prompt.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An input TLE object can be also used as a coordinate origin (an observing
point) at any time, as explained below.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="local-tle-id-number">Local TLE ID Number:</h3>

<p>Internally, the TLE ID (columns 3-7, so <code>87820</code> in the example above) is
prefixed with a <code>-8</code> such that the temporary Horizons ID would be <code>-887820</code>.</p>

<p>This internal ID is displayed on the output, and can be used if you need to
specify an observing point with respect to a user-input artifical satellite.</p>

<h3 id="user-defined-tle-objects-as-observatories">User-Defined TLE Objects as Observatories</h3>

<p>Once defined, a TLE object can be used in the same way as other objects
available from this system.</p>

<p>To generate an ephemeris of the Moon with respect to the TLE object, one
would input TLEs such as those above, then select the Moon as a target, then
specify a coordinate origin of <code>@ -887820</code>.</p>

<p>The output lunar ephemeris would then be with respect to the user-input
TLE object.</p>

<p>Equivalently, one can specify the observing center with <code>@ TLE</code> notation.
This will use the last TLE object input as the coordinate origin. Only one
such TLE object can be defined at a time; new TLE input deletes the prior
specification.</p>

<p>Since Horizons maintains trajectories for some Earth-orbiting satellites,
this capability means one can produce satellite-to-satellite ephemerides and
generate relative position data for them.</p>

<p>Examples of satellite-to-satellite specification:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To observe the input TLE object from the already-in-Horizons
International Space Station (ISS), request target <code>TLE</code> (or <code>-887820</code>, for
the example above), then set observing point as <code>@ -125544</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To instead observe ISS from the input TLE object, request target <code>-125544</code>,
then set the observing point as <code>@tle</code> (or <code>@ -887820</code>, for the example above).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-idoutput-classanchor-under-tabacustomizing-output"><a id="output" class="anchor-under-tab"></a>Customizing Output</h2>

<p>There are four types of output tables users can request and customize:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cartesian state vectors</li>
  <li>Osculating orbital element tables</li>
  <li>Observer tables</li>
  <li>Close-approach tables</li>
</ol>

<p>Keys are embedded in output ephemerides to assist with automated reading of
the output by users’ own software. The keys are:</p>

<pre>
    $$SOE    Start of ephemeris
    $$EOE    End of ephemeris
</pre>

<p>The ‘*’ symbols below denote login defaults.</p>

<p>Tables types 1-3 may be optionally output in a “comma-separated-value”
format for import into spreadsheets.</p>

<h3 id="cartesian-state-vector-table">1. Cartesian state vector table</h3>

<p>Overview and usage:</p>

<p>This type of table provides the position and velocity at an instant of any
object with respect to any major body or specified point on its surface.
Such output would be of interest to those working on dynamical studies or
needing the motion described in 3-dimensional space as a function of time.</p>

<p>Note that for comets and asteroids, SPK binary files can be generated by
users. Such files continuously represent this same state vector information
in a way that can be interpolated by user software at any intermediate
instant. SPK files for major bodies, such as planets and natural satellites,
must be obtained separately, such as from the Solar System Dynamics group:</p>

<p><a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/ftp/eph/planets/bsp">https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/ftp/eph/planets/bsp</a></p>

<p><a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/ftp/eph/satellites/bsp">https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/ftp/eph/satellites/bsp</a></p>

<p>… or from the NAIF node of the NASA Planetary Data System (PDS),</p>

<p><a href="https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/data_generic.html">https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/data_generic.html</a></p>

<p>… but not through Horizons, which creates and distributes SPK files for
asteroids and comets only.</p>

<p>Specify one of the basic vector table output types by its numeric code (1-6).</p>

<p>The DEFAULT is table type 3 (with no statistical uncertainties).</p>

<p>Statistical uncertainties can be requested on table types 1 and 2 by adding
coordinate system code(s) <code>x</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>r</code>, or <code>p</code> after the integer, where
<code>x</code> refers to XYZ, <code>a</code> to ACN, <code>r</code> to RTN, and <code>p</code> to POS.</p>

<p>For example, <code>1xa</code> returns position components with their uncertainties
in XYZ and ACN coordinate systems; <code>2ap</code> returns position and velocity, with
their uncertainties in ACN and POS coordinates.</p>

<p>If no statistical data is available for a given target but uncertainty output
is requested, “n.a.” symbols will appear in output (meaning “not available”).</p>

<h3 id="osculating-orbital-elements-table">2. Osculating orbital elements table</h3>

<p>Overview and usage:</p>

<p>The instantaneous osculating orbital elements of an object with respect
to a planet or barycenter.</p>

<p>Orbital elements encode the position and velocity (the state vector) at one
instant in a geometrically meaningful way and can be used to initialize
comet and asteroid numerical integrations. They should be used cautiously
for any other purpose.</p>

<h3 id="observer-table">3. Observer table</h3>

<p>Overview and usage:</p>

<p>The output values in observer tables are “as seen” by an observer, being
compensated for aberrations such as light-time and other significant
perspective-dependent effects.</p>

<p>Observer tables may be produced for any target object as seen by an observer
from topocentric coordinates on or at the center of a major body (planet,
natural satellite, spacecraft, and some asteroids) with a defined rotation
model.</p>

<p>Targets can also be specified as surface coordinates on another major body,
such as a crater.</p>

<p>Default quantities that are always present in an observer table: include</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Time
 Universal Time (UT) or Terrestrial Time (TT) output timescales can
 be selected</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Solar-presence symbol

 is above or below the local horizon)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lunar-presence
 Indicates if the Moon’s limb is above or below the local horizon</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Additional user-selectable quantities are output in the order selected.
The desired output quantities must be specified at least once. No initial
default output exists in telnet or e-mail interfaces.</p>

<p>A detailed explanation of the user-selectable output quantities is given
later, but are briefly listed here along with their selection integer:</p>

       C = Body-center observer -&gt; Small-body target
       D = Topocentric observer -&gt; Small-body target
       E = Bodycentric observer -&gt; Spacecraft target
       F = Topocentric observer -&gt; Spacecraft target
</pre>

<p>The alphabetic short-cut macros specifically include these quantities:</p>

<pre>
       A = 1-48
       B = 1-3, 6, 9-33, 36-41, 43-46, 47

       F = 1-5, 8, 10, 18-25, 29, 41-48
</pre>

<p>… with the macros for small-body cases (C and D) primarily skipping
cartographic dependent quantities. Note that some small bodies (such as Ida,
Gaspra, Eros, etc.) are exceptions, having IAU-defined mapping grids. For such
special cases, options C &amp; D won’t provide all available data.</p>

<p>“n.a.” is output in the ephemeris if a requested quantity is not available
for a selected target object. The alphabetic macro codes are intended to help
reduce the appearance of “n.a.” symbols in the final output. For example, when
azimuth and elevation are requested for a geocentric ephemeris, or orbital
uncertainies for an object without a covariance, these quantities will always
be undefined and return an “n.a.” if requested.</p>

<p>Some quantities, such as apparent visual magnitude (#9), may display values
in the ephemeris output, but then switch to “n.a.” if moving outside the range
of valid calculation. For example, if the phase angle becomes high enough
that the magnitude model ceases to be accurate, numeric values will not be
output and the “n.a.” marker will be output instead.</p>

<p>The ‘*’ symbols in the quantity list above indicate quantities affected by
user selection of airless or refraction-correction. Refraction correction, if
requested, is available only for Earth (or body-centered observers, for which
the refraction is zero since all directions are zenith).  “n.a’ will be
returned for all other observers.</p>

<p>The ‘&gt;’ symbol above marks small-body statistical quantities computable when
a covariance matrix is available in the database or supplied by users. If such
a quantity is requested but no statistical propagation is available for the
object, the “n.a.” symbol will be output.</p>

<h3 id="close-approach-table-small-bodies-only">4. Close-approach table (small-bodies ONLY)</h3>

<p>Overview and usage:</p>

<p>Requesting this table type (via telnet or e-mail) activates monitoring
of close-approaches by the small-body target to the planets and 16 most
massive asteroid perturbers. This table is not available for major body
targets, only comets and asteroids numerically integrated by Horizons.</p>

<p>Each time an encounter minimum distance with one of the 25 objects is
detected, one-line of information is generated to summarize the encounter
conditions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Close-approach detection limits that trigger output can be changed by
users, but the default values are:</li>
</ul>

<pre>
    Other small-bodies (i.e., the set of 16 large perturbing asteroids)

      0.10 au

    Planetary bodies

      Merc  Venu  Eart  Mars  Jupi  Satu  Nept  Uran  Plut  Moon

  To change these values, input a comma-separated list of values (when
  prompted) up to the last one of interest. For example, to change the
  Earth encounter limit from 0.1 au to 0.2 au, enter:

      0.1, 0.1, 0.2

  The values of Mercury and Venus will remain 0.1 au, but the value for
  the third entry, Earth, will be changed to 0.2 au.
</pre>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Table generation will be automatically cut-off early if the 3-sigma
statistical uncertainty in the time of the encounter exceeds a default
value of +/- 14400 minutes (+/- 10 days). Users can change this limit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Users may also toggle output of extended output lines for detected
encounters. This provides additional statistical information on the
encounter. See the section on “Close Approach Tables” below, for a

<h2 id="a-idobsquan-classanchor-under-tabadefinition-of-observer-table-quantities"><a id="obsquan" class="anchor-under-tab"></a>Definition of Observer Table Quantities</h2>

<p>The detailed description of the selectable observer table quantities follows.
“Labels” refers to column headings at the start of the output table.</p>

<h3 id="a-idtime-outputatime"><a id="time-output"></a>Time</h3>

<p>One output line for each step. The line begins with a ‘b’ if the date is BC,
a blank (“ “) if AD. This is followed by the date and time, which is either
UT or TT, in calendar or JD format (or both), depending on user defaults.</p>

<p>Time tags refer to the time-scale conversion from TDB on Earth regardless of
observer location within the solar system, although clock rates may differ due
to the local gravity field and no analogous time-scales are locally defined.</p>

<h3 id="solar-presence">Solar Presence</h3>

<p>Time tag is followed by a blank, then a solar-presence symbol that indicates
twilight and dawn conditions also:</p>

<pre>
    '*'  Daylight (refracted solar upper-limb on or above apparent horizon)
    'C'  Civil twilight/dawn
    'N'  Nautical twilight/dawn
    'A'  Astronomical twilight/dawn
    ' '  Night OR geocentric ephemeris
</pre>

<h3 id="lunarinterfering-body-presence">Lunar/Interfering Body Presence</h3>

<p>The solar presence symbol is immediately followed by an “interfering body”
presence symbol (which will indicate the Moon for Earth observers):</p>

<pre>
    'm'  Refracted upper-limb of Moon (or interfering body, 'i') is on or above
          apparent horizon
    ' '  Refracted upper-limb of Moon (or interfering body) is below the
          apparent horizon, or geocentric ephemeris

The lunar/IB presence marker (an ongoing state) can be over-ridden by a target
event marker if an event has occurred since the last output step:

    'r'  Rise          (target body on or above cut-off RTS elevation)
    'e'  Elevation max (target body maximum elevation angle has occurred)
    't'  Transit       (target body at or passed through observer meridian)
    's'  Set           (target body on or below cut-off RTS elevation)
</pre>

<p>The ‘rets’ codes will be displayed under two conditions only: if the print
interval is less than or equal to 30 minutes or the RTS-only print option has
been selected.</p>

<p>For non-Earth observing sites, no twilight/dawn codes (C, N, or A) are
output, refraction is not modeled and the interfering body marker is ‘i’
instead of the ‘m’ reserved for Earth’s Moon.</p>

<h3 id="statistical-uncertainties">Statistical Uncertainties</h3>

<p>Output for asteroids and comets can include formal +/- 3-standard-deviation
statistical orbit uncertainty quantities. There is a 99.7% chance the actual
value is within given bounds.  These statistical calculations assume
observational data errors are random. If there are systematic biases (such as
measurement timing, reduction, or star-catalog errors), results can be
optimistic. Because the epoch covariance is mapped using linearized variational
partial derivatives, results can also be optimistic for times far from the
solution epoch, particularly for objects having close planetary encounters.</p>

<p>NOTE: “n.a.” is output if a requested quantity is not available for selected
      object. For example, azimuth and elevation for a geocentric ephemeris,
      or uncertainties for an object with no covariance in the database.</p>

<h3 id="specific-quantities">Specific Quantities</h3>

<h4 id="astrometric-ra--dec">1. Astrometric RA &amp; DEC</h4>

<pre>
Adjusted for light-time aberration only. With respect to the reference
plane and equinox of the chosen system (ICRF or FK4/B1950). If the
FK4/B1950 frame output is selected, elliptic aberration terms are added.
Astrometric RA/DEC is generally used when comparing or reducing data
against a star catalog.

<h4 id="apparent-ra--dec">2. Apparent RA &amp; DEC</h4>

<pre>
Apparent right ascension and declination of the target with respect to
the specified observing center/site. "Apparent" can have three different
meanings, depending on where the observer is located:

A) For EARTH-BASED sites

   Apparent coordinates are with respect to the true-equator and Earth
   equinox of-date coordinate system (EOP-corrected IAU76/80 precession
   and nutation of the spin-pole) and adjusted to model light-time, the
   gravitational deflection of light, and stellar aberration, with an
   optional (approximate) correction for atmospheric yellow-light
   refraction.

   Apparent RA/DEC for Earth-based sites is generally used when physically
   aligning a telescope on the surface with the equator and pole of-date.

B) For NON-EARTH SITES WITHOUT ROTATIONAL MODELS

   Apparent RA and DEC are with respect to the REFERENCE FRAME coordinate
   system (ICRF or FK4/B1950), but still adjusted for light-time, the
   gravitational deflection of light and stellar aberration.

C) For NON-EARTH SITES WITH ROTATIONAL MODELS

   The origin of RA is the meridian containing the reference frame Earth
   equinox (ICRF or FK4/B1950) with the X-Y equator plane defined by the
   IAU rotational model. Adjusted for light-time, gravitational deflection
   of light, and stellar aberration.  No refraction model is available.

The angular rate of change in aparent RA and DEC of the target. This is
with respect to the non-inertial IAU76/80 Earth true equator and equinox

</pre>

<h4 id="apparent-azimuth--elevation-az-el-">4. Apparent azimuth &amp; elevation (AZ-EL) :</h4>

<pre>
Apparent azimuth and elevation of target. Adjusted for light-time,
the gravitational deflection of light, stellar aberration, precession and
nutation. There is an optional (approximate) adjustment for atmospheric
refraction (Earth only). Azimuth is measured clockwise from north:

  North(0) -&gt; East(90) -&gt; South(180) -&gt; West(270)

Elevation angle is with respect to plane perpendicular to local zenith
direction.  TOPOCENTRIC ONLY.

  Units: DEGREES

<pre>
Satellite apparent differential coordinates in the plane-of-sky with
respect to the primary body along with the satellite position angle.
Differential coordinates are defined in RA as:

  Labels:  L_Ap_Sid_Time
</pre>

<h4 id="airmass--visual-magnitude-extinction">8. Airmass &amp; visual magnitude extinction</h4>

<pre>
_RELATIVE_ optical airmass with visual magnitude extinction. Airmass is
the ratio of the absolute optical airmass at the targets' refracted
elevation angle with the absolute optical airmass at zenith. Also output
is the estimated visual magnitude extinction due to atmosphere, as seen by
the observer. _VALUES ARE OUTPUT ONLY FOR TOPOCENTRIC EARTH SITES WHEN THE
TARGET IS ABOVE THE HORIZON_.

  Units: None (airmass) and magnitudes (extinction)

  Labels:  a-mass mag_ex
</pre>

<h4 id="visual-magnitude--surface-brightness">9. Visual magnitude &amp; surface brightness</h4>

<pre>
Approximate airless visual magnitude &amp; surface brightness, where surface
brightness is the average airless visual magnitude of a square-arcsecond
of the illuminated portion of the apparent disk.

Planets &amp; satellites: Value for Pluto includes Charon. The Saturn rings
are included when phase angle is less than 6.5 degrees and effective
inclination less than 27 degrees.  When the Moon is at phase angles &lt; 7
degrees (within 1 day of full), the computed magnitude tends to be ~ 0.12
too dim.

Asteroids &amp; comets: Surface brightness is returned for asteroids only if a
radius is known. Magnitudes are, in principle, accurate to about +/- 0.1
magnitude. However, measurement and calibration issues mean values should
be considered uncertain at the +/- 1.0 magnitude level.  In practice, for
solar phase angles &gt; 90 deg, the error could exceed 1 magnitude. Reduced
precision values are output for phase angles greater than 120 degrees,
since the errors could be large and unknown. Some comets have custom
magnitude laws that are described at the end of the requested ephemeris
output.

  Units are (none) and VISUAL MAGNITUDES PER SQUARE ARCSECOND.

  Magnitude laws:

    Sun
      APmag= M - 5 + 5*log10(d), where M=4.83, d=distance from Sun (parsecs)

    Asteroids

      N-mag=M2 + 5*log10(delta) + k2*log10(r) + phcof*beta

  Non-standard comet magnitude laws may be noted at the end of the output
  ephemeris for some cases.

diameter NOT illuminated by the Sun.

  Units: ARCSECONDS

  Labels:  Def_illu
</pre>

<h4 id="angular-separationvisibility">12. Angular separation/visibility</h4>

<pre>
The angular separation between the center of the target object and the
center of the (remote) primary body it revolves around, as seen by the
observer, with target visibility code. The observer cannot be on the
primary body.

Visibility codes (refers to limb-to-limb):

    /t = Transiting primary body disk    /O = Occulted by primary body disk
    /p = Partial umbral eclipse          /P = Occulted partial umbral eclipse
    /u = Total umbral eclipse            /U = Occulted total umbral eclipse
    /- = Target is the primary body      /* = None of above ("free and clear")

The radius of both primary and target body is taken to be the equatorial
value (maximum, given a triaxial shape). Atmospheric effects and oblateness
aspect are _NOT_ currently considered.  Light-time is considered.

  Labels:   ang-sep/v
</pre>

<h4 id="target-angular-diameter">13. Target angular diameter</h4>

<pre>
The equatorial angular width of the target body full disk, if it were
fully illuminated and visible to the observer. If the target body diameter
is unknown, "n.a." is output.

  Labels: Ang-diam
</pre>

<h4 id="observer-sub-longitude--sub-latitude">14. Observer sub-longitude &amp; sub-latitude</h4>

<pre>
Apparent planetodetic longitude and latitude of the center of the target disc
seen by the OBSERVER at print-time. This is not exactly the same as the
"nearest point" for a non-spherical target shape (since the center of the disc
might not be the point closest to the observer), but is generally very close
if not a very irregular body shape. The IAU2009 rotation models are used except
for Earth and MOON, which use higher-precision models. For the gas giants
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, IAU2009 longitude is based on the
"System III" prime meridian rotation angle of the magnetic field. By contrast,
pole direction (thus latitude) is relative to the body dynamical equator. There
can be an offset between the magnetic pole and the dynamical pole of rotation.
Down-leg light travel-time from target to observer is taken into account.
Latitude is the angle between the equatorial plane and perpendicular to the
reference ellipsoid of the body and body oblateness thereby included. The
reference ellipsoid is an oblate spheroid with a single flatness coefficient
in which the y-axis body radius is taken to be the same value as the x-axis
radius. Whether longitude is positive to the east or west for the target will
be indicated at the end of the output ephemeris.

  Units: DEGREES

  Labels: ObsSub-LON ObsSub-LAT
</pre>

<h4 id="solar-sub-longitude--sub-latitude">15. Solar sub-longitude &amp; sub-latitude</h4>

<pre>
Apparent sub-solar longitude and latitude of the Sun on the target. The
apparent planetodetic longitude and latitude of the center of the target
disc as seen from the Sun, as seen by the observer at print-time.  This is
_NOT_ exactly the same as the "sub-solar" (nearest) point for a non-spherical
target shape (since the center of the disc seen from the Sun might not be
the closest point to the Sun), but is very close if not a highly irregular
body shape.  Light travel-time from Sun to target and from target to
observer is taken into account.  Latitude is the angle between the
equatorial plane and the line perpendicular to the reference ellipsoid of
the body. The reference ellipsoid is an oblate spheroid with a single
flatness coefficient in which the y-axis body radius is taken to be the
same value as the x-axis radius. Uses IAU2009 rotation models except for
Earth and Moon, which uses a higher precision models. Values for Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are Set III, referring to rotation of their
magnetic fields.  Whether longitude is positive to the east or west for
the target will be indicated at the end of the output ephemeris.

<h4 id="solar-range--range-rate--relative-to-target">19. Solar range &amp; range-rate  (relative to target)</h4>

<pre>

<pre>
Magnitude of the targets' velocity with respect to the Sun center and
the observer at the time light left the target to be observed (print time
minus down-leg light-time). These are absolute values of the velocity
vectors (total speeds) and do NOT indicate direction of motion.

<h4 id="sun-observer-target-apparent-solar-elongation-angle">23. Sun-Observer-Target (apparent solar elongation) angle</h4>

<pre>
Sun-Observer-Target apparent SOLAR ELONGATION ANGLE seen from the
observers' location at print-time.

The '/r' column provides a code indicating the targets' apparent
position relative to the Sun in the observers' sky, as described below:

Case A: For an observing location on the surface of a rotating body, that
body rotational sense is considered:

    /T indicates target TRAILS Sun (evening sky: rises and sets AFTER Sun)
    /L indicates target LEADS Sun  (morning sky: rises and sets BEFORE Sun)

Case B: For an observing point that does not have a rotational model (such
as a spacecraft), the "leading" and "trailing" condition is defined by the
observers' heliocentric ORBITAL motion:

* If continuing in the observers' current direction of heliocentric
  motion would encounter the targets' apparent longitude first,
  followed by the Sun's, the target LEADS the Sun as seen by the
  observer.

* If the Sun's apparent longitude would be encountered first, followed
  by the targets', the target TRAILS the Sun.

Two other codes can be output:

    /* indicates observer is Sun-centered    (undefined)
    /? Target is aligned with Sun center     (no lead or trail)

The S-O-T solar elongation angle is numerically the minimum separation
angle of the Sun and target in the sky in any direction. It does NOT
indicate the amount of separation in the leading or trailing directions,
which would be defined along the equator of a spherical coordinate system.

frame north-pole. Computed for small-bodies only (and primarily intended
for ACTIVE COMETS), "PsAng" is an indicator of the comets' gas-tail
orientation in the sky (being in the anti-sunward direction) while "PsAMV"
is an indicator of dust-tail orientation.

distinction between TT and TDB is not maintained. For 1962 and later, the
difference is with respect to UTC (TDB-UTC) and periodic terms less than
1.e-6 second are ignored. Values beyond the next July or January 1st may

<h4 id="apparent-target-centered-longitude-of-the-sun-apparent-ls">44. Apparent target-centered longitude of the Sun (apparent L_s)</h4>

<pre>
The apparent target-centered longitude of the Sun ("apparent L_s") as
seen at the target when the light recorded by the observer at print-time
reflected off the target. It is referred to a coordinate system where the
x-axis is the equinox direction defined by the targets' instantaneous
pole direction and heliocentric orbit plane at reflection time, and is
measured positively in an eastward direction (counter-clockwise around
the positive pole of the solar system angular momentum vector). The quantity
can indicate boundary dates for the target-body seasons as follows:

     Northern hemisphere           Southern hemisphere
       0= Spring Equinox             0= Autumn Equinox
      90= Summer Solstice           90= Winter Solstice
     180= Autumn Equinox           180= Spring Equinox
     270= Winter Solstice          270= Summer Solstice

If the target has no associated spin-pole model (common for asteroids
and comets), "n.a." will be output.

To obtain L_s observed on the target (minimizing light-time lag due to
remote observing of target), specify an observing point near the target
if possible, such as on a nearby natural satellite.

NOTE: For Earth, due to substantial Earth-Moon mutual motion, the
convention is to define seasonal boundaries using the geocentric apparent
ecliptic longitude of the Sun, not apparent L_s. Therefore, to determine
Earth seasons, request quantity #31 ("ObsEcLon") as seen from the
geocenter, with the Sun as a target.  The ecliptic plane used to define
Earth seasons is a mean-of-date plane, not the true-of-date plane used for
determining seasons on other solar system bodies, as with this L_s
quantity.

<h4 id="sky-brightness-and-target-visual-signal-to-noise-ratio-snr">48. Sky brightness and target visual signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)</h4>

<pre>
Sky brightness due to moonlight scattering by Earth's atmosphere at the
target's position in the sky. "sky_SNR" is the visual signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) of the target's surface brightness relative to background sky. Output
only for topocentric Earth observers when both the Moon and target are above
the local horizon and the Sun is in astronomical twilight (or further) below
the horizon, and the target is not the Moon or Sun. If all conditions are
not met, "n.a." is output. Galactic brightness, local sky light-pollution
and weather are NOT considered. Lunar opposition surge is considered. The
value returned is accurate under ideal conditions at the approximately 8-23%
level, so is a useful but not definitive value.

If the target-body radius is also known, "sky_SNR" is output. This is the
approximate visual signal-to-noise ratio of the target's brightness divided
by lunar sky brightness. When sky_SNR &lt; 1, the target is dimmer than the
ideal moonlight-scattering background sky, so unlikely to be detectable at
visual wavelengths. In practice, visibility requires sky_SNR &gt; 1 and a
detector sensitive enough to reach the target's magnitude, even if it isn't
washed out by moonlight. When relating magnitudes and brightness values,
keep in mind their logarithmic relationship m2-m1 = -2.5*log_10(b2/b1).

<h2 id="a-idca-classanchor-under-tabaclose-approach-tables"><a id="ca" class="anchor-under-tab"></a>Close-Approach Tables</h2>

<p>For asteroids and comets, a close-approach table may be requested. Output
is produced only when the selected object reaches a minimum distance within a
user-adjustable spherical radius from a planet or one of the sixteen largest
asteroids used as pertubers in the small-body equations of motion.</p>

<p>User-specifications for this table can include the time-span to check, the
radius of detection for planets and asteroids, the maximum uncertainty in
time-of-close-approach before the table is automatically cut-off, and whether
to output optional error ellipse information projected into the B-plane</p>

<p>The B-plane mentioned above is defined by the three orthogonal unit vectors
T, R, and S (the origin being the body center). T lies in the B-plane, pointing
in the direction of decreasing celestial longitude. R lies in the B-plane,
pointing in the direction of decreasing celestial latitude (south). S is
directed along the relative velocity vector at body encounter, perpendicular
to the B-plane, and thus R and T. The B vector is the vector in the plane from
the body to the point where the incoming objects’ velocity asymptote pierces
the R-T plane. Note the B-plane is defined only when the incoming object is
hyperbolic with respect to the body.</p>

<p>For objects with covariances, statistical quantities are output for each
close-approach. All tabulated statistical quantities (MinDist, MaxDist, TCA3Sg,
Nsigs and P_i/p) are based on a linearized covariance mapping in which
higher-order (small) terms in the variational partial derivatives of the
equations of motion are dropped.</p>

<p>Due to possible non-linearities in any given objects’ actual dynamics, this
can result in significant errors at epochs distant in time from the solution
epoch.  Consequently, long linearized mappings (thousands, or hundreds, or
sometimes just dozens of years from the present time) should be considered
approximate, pending additional analysis, especially in these cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>objects with numerous close planetary encounters (dozens),</li>
  <li>objects with very close planetary encounters (&lt; 0.01 AU),</li>
  <li>objects with very short data arcs (days or weeks).</li>
</ul>

<p>While linearized projections will tend to indicate such cases with obviously
rapid uncertainty growth, the specific numbers output can tend to understate
orbit uncertainty knowledge.</p>

<p>Possible output quantities are described below. “Nominal” effectively means
“highest-probability for the given orbit solution”, although there can be other
possible orbits of equal probability.</p>

<p>If there is no covariance, no statistical quantities (marked by ‘&gt;’ are
returned. Statistical quantities output only if the user requests an “extended”
close-approach table are marked by “&gt;*” symbols:</p>

<h2 id="a-idrts-classanchor-under-tabaunderstanding-rise-elevation-max-transit-and-set-indicators"><a id="rts" class="anchor-under-tab"></a>Understanding Rise, Elevation-max, Transit and Set Indicators</h2>

<p>There are 2 ways the system can be used to mark rise, maximum elevation,
transit, and set (RETS) conditions: (1) activate the RTS-only print option
for an observer-table request OR (2) request a general observer table with
output step interval less than 30 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="normal-table-rets-marker-mode">Normal Table RETS-Marker Mode</h3>

<p>RETS is indicated automatically during normal observer table generation,
when the step-size is less than 30 minutes. Markers are placed to indicate
the event occurred at some point in the previous step. Therefore, precision of
the indicator depends on the step-size selected. For this mode, rise and set
are always with respect to the true-visual-horizon reference plane (TVH),
described below.</p>

<h3 id="rts-only-print-mode">RTS-Only Print Mode</h3>

<p>The advantage of this mode is it allows production of a more compact RTS
table over a longer time-span than does the “normal” table generation mode.</p>

<p>When RTS-only print is selected, the program will search for the events at
a user-specified resolution, from 1 to 9 minutes. Output will be generated ONLY
for these three events.  Maximum elevation is not included. The marker symbols
in the table indicate that the event took place sometime in the previous step
interval.</p>

<p>This RTS-only mode can be turned on at two different points in the program
(command-line interface):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Preferably, when specifying the ephemeris/search step-size</li>
  <li>… but also in the “change defaults” prompt structure</li>
</ol>

<p>Three types of criteria are available for the rise and set conditions,
relative to an input elevation angle (nominally 0 degrees). Select by
specifying, when prompted at #1 or #2, one of these symbols:</p>

<pre>
    TVH ... True visual horizon plane. The horizon seen by an observer on
              the reference ellipsoid. Allows for horizon dip effect and
              atmospheric refraction, but not local topography.

    GEO ... Geometric horizon plane. The horizon is defined by the plane
              perpendicular to the reference ellipsoid local zenith (no
              horizon dip).  Atmospheric refraction is estimated.

    RAD ... Radar case. Geometric horizon plane, no atmospheric refraction.
</pre>

<p>For example, when prompted for the step-size, one could enter “5 min GEO’
to search, at five-minute steps, for the refracted rise/set relative to the
geometric horizon.</p>

<h3 id="background-description">Background Description</h3>

<p>Rise and set elevations are taken to be the maximum of 0 or the input
elevation cut-off value (0-90 deg), set in the “change defaults” prompt
section. Thus, if there are local hills, one could set the elevation
cut-off at 10 degrees and get RETS relative to that elevation.</p>

<p>At low elevations, these rise/set times should be viewed as approximations,
realistically good to perhaps only 1-2 minutes at the horizon due to local
atmospheric variation, weather, and topography.</p>

<p>To speed RTS-only searches, use the largest step-size compatible with the
required accuracy. For example, considering the inherent atmospheric
instability at the horizon, one should rarely need to identify rise/set to
better than 5 minute accuracy for optical observations near the horizon.
Setting a search-step of 5 minutes will then produce a table 5 times faster
than 1 minute searching.</p>

<p>Radar, other low frequency observations, or optical observations at higher
elevations, can be less affected by atmospheric effects and warrant finer
resolution determination.</p>

<p>The program computes approximate refraction angles assuming yellow-light
observations at 10 deg C sea-level with pressure of 1010 millibars. Corrected
coordinates should be accurate to &lt; 10 arcsec, but errors may be much larger
near the horizon (+- 0.3 deg) or fluctuate unpredictably with local weather.</p>

<p>Both Moon and Sun rise/set are based on when the refracted upper limb
of the object reaches the specified elevation. Transit and maximum elevation
are based on the center of the target body.</p>

<p>Transit (or “upper culmination”) is when the target’s center crosses the
observer’s meridian. Maximum elevation is the highest angle above the local
horizons. The two conditions can occur at times differing by seconds or even
minutes for close objects moving quickly.</p>

<p>Horizons gives priority to the transit ‘t’ marker if output resolution is too
coarse to distinguish the times (no ‘e’ marker output).</p>

<p>Some objects such as orbiting spacecraft may not transit the observer’s meridian
but still have a maximum elevation angle, therefore can have an ‘e’ marker but
no ‘t’ marker.</p>

<h2 id="a-idconstellations-classanchor-under-tabaconstellation-identification"><a id="constellations" class="anchor-under-tab"></a>Constellation Identification</h2>

field will contain a three letter abbreviation of the constellation name, from

<h3 id="solar-system-model">Solar System Model</h3>

<p>The JPL DE-441 solar system solution [1] is the basis of planetary
barycenter motion data over the interval from 13201 B.C. to A.D. 17191;
Horizons currently makes available only the sub-interval from 9999 BC to
A.D. 9999 (until its Y10K problem is fully handled).</p>

<p>The Chebyshev polynomial representation of DE441 permits rapid recovery
of the original barycenter integrator state to the sub-meter level. This
difference in representation is much less than the uncertainty associated with
the trajectory solution itself.</p>

<p>Horizons uses DE441 for the following objects:</p>

<pre>
    Objects                      ID code #
    ---------------------------  -------------------
    All planet barycenters       0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
    Sun                          10
    Moon                         301
    Mercury                      199
    Venus                        299
    Earth                        399
</pre>

<p>Natural satellites and planet-centers are determined separately, and available
over various shorter intervals, as warranted by their observational data arc,
but generally hundreds of years.</p>

<p>Planet-center offsets from the planetary system barycenter they move with
respect to (barycentric shift vectors) are defined by the satellite solutions.
Consequently, planet-centers are available only over the shorter intervals
of that planet’s natural satellite solution.</p>

<p>For example, while the center of Mars (499) is available over a few hundred
years as defined by the solution for the motions of the moons Phobos and Deimos,
the Mars system barycenter (4) is available over 9999 B.C. to A.D. 9999.</p>

<p>The difference between the position of a planet center and planetary system
barycenter is often not important unless one has a spacecraft in the vicinity
or is studying the offset. Therefore, specifying barycenters (body-code integers
less than 10) is typically acceptable if the longer time-span is of interest.
This is particularly the case when generating osculating orbital elements,
since specifying barycenters as targets and coordinate origins can remove
high-frequency terms in the osculating elements caused by a planets’ motion
with respect to its local system barycenter.</p>

<p>Comets and asteroids are numerically integrated on demand over a maximum
interval of A.D. 1600 to A.D. 2500.  Some ancient comets may be available
outside that span for their relevant historical period. Only a relatively small
number of such small-bodies have sufficiently well-determined orbits to justify
rigorous integration over time-spans of hundreds of years. Statistical
uncertainty information derived from mapped covariances is available to
help the user determine the limits of useful numerical integration.</p>

<p>For an overview of how this information is developed, see
<a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/orbits_doc.html">https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/orbits_doc.html</a></p>

<h3 id="precession-model">Precession Model</h3>

<p>For the time-span of 1799-Jan-1 to 2202-Jan-1, the IAU 1976 precession model
of Lieske is used [9]. As published, this model is valid for only ~200 years
on either side of the J2000.0 epoch. This is due to round-off error in the
published coefficients and truncation to a 3rd order polynomial in the
expressions for the Euler rotation angles. Therefore, outside this interval,
the long-term precession and obliquity model of Owen [10] is used to maintain
accuracy in the calculation of apparent (“of-date”) quantities.</p>

<p>This model (Owen) is a rigorous numerical integration of the equations of motion
of the celestial pole using Kinoshita’s model for the speed of luni-solar
precession.</p>

<h3 id="nutation-model">Nutation Model</h3>

<p>The IAU (1980) model of Wahr is used [11]. This is the same table printed
in the 1992 Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac. Note there is
an error in the Explanatory Supplement for the Node term, given on p. 114 as:</p>

<p><code>OMEGA = 135deg 2'40.280" + ...</code></p>

<p>This system uses the correct formulation:</p>

<p><code>OMEGA = 125deg 2'40.280" + ...</code></p>

<h3 id="itrf93">ITRF93</h3>

<p>The IAU76/80 Lieske/Wahr precession-nutation model is then corrected to produce
of-date equator and equinox relative coordinates using compatible GPS-derived
data in Earth-orientation parameter (EOP) files produced by JPL (and also the
IERS) a few times a week. This EOP data contains measured offsets as a function
of time with respect to the theory’s predicted precession and nutation angles,
as well as polar motion terms needed to go from “true-of-date” to ITRF93/WGS84
terrestrial frames used with maps and GPS to specify surface locations.</p>

<h3 id="universal-time-tdb---ut-conversion">Universal Time (TDB -&gt; UT Conversion)</h3>

<p>This program internally uses the TDB time-scale of the ephemerides (the
independent variable in the equations of motion). To produce the more familiar
Universal Time (UT) clock-time output linked to the Earth’s variable rotation,
it is necessary to use historical reconstructions of old or ancient observations
of constrained events, such as eclipses, to derive a TDB-UT difference. This
program currently uses the analyses of [8] as follows:</p>

<pre>
    Span                TDB-UT offset  ("delta-t")   Type   Argument (T=...)
    ------------------- --------------------------   ----   ------------------
    9999 BC to 700 BC   -10 + 31.4 * T^2              UT1   cent. since JD1825
     700 BC to AD 1962  Stephenson/Morrison spline    UT1   Besselian date
    AD 1962 to Current  EOP file                      UTC   Date
    Present to AD 9999  Last EOP file prediction      UTC   Date
</pre>

<p>For epochs after 1962, the calculation is as follows:</p>

<pre>
    TDB - UTC = (TDB - TAI) + (TAI - UTC)

... where

    TDB - TAI = Computed from current planetary ephemeris
    TAI - UTC = Interpolated from current EOP file
</pre>

<p>… dropping terms in TDB-TAI having an RSS of ~4.2 usec. For dates prior to
1962-Jan-20, the periodically varying distinction between TDB and TT (with
maximum offset of 0.002 seconds) is not maintained since the historical data
does not support that level of accuracy.</p>

<p>As one progresses to earlier times, particularly those prior to the 1620
telescopic data span, uncertainties in conversion to UT generally (though not
always and not uniformly) increase due to less precise observations and sparser
records. At A.D. 948, uncertainty (not necessarily error) can be a few minutes.
At 3000 B.C., the uncertainty in UT is about 4 hours.  The TT time scale, being
a uniform atomic timescale, does not have this uncertainty, but is not directly
related to Earth’s rotation (local civil time) either.</p>

<h3 id="greenwich-mean-sidereal-time">Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time</h3>

<p>The GMST used for topocentric ephemerides is related to UT1 using a
standard model consistent with the adopted IAU 1976 system of constants:</p>

<pre>
    GMST= 67310.548 + (3155760000. + 8640184.812866)*T_u + 0.093104*T_u^2
          - 6.2e-6 * T_u^3
</pre>

<p>… where T_u is Julian centuries of 36525 days of 86400 seconds of UT1
elapsed since January 1, 2000 12:00 UT1 (J2000.0; JD 2451545.0). That is,
T_u = UT1/(86400*36525), where UT1 is seconds of Universal Time UT1 elapsed
since January 1, 2000 12:00 UT1.</p>

<p>The IERS (1992) equation of the equinoxes is used to obtain true sidereal time
(true_sidereal_time = GMST + delta_THETA):</p>

<pre>
    delta_THETA = delta_PSI*cos(EPSILON) + 0.00264*sin(OMEGA)
                  + 0.000063*sin(2*OMEGA)

    ... where delta_PSI = nutation in longitude
              EPSILON   = mean obliquity of ecliptic
              OMEGA     = longitude of mean ascending node of lunar orbit
                           on the ecliptic
</pre>

<p>The FK4/B1950 GMST relationship is adopted from the 1961 Explanatory
Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris, H.M. Nautical Almanac Office.</p>

<h3 id="high-precision-earth-orientation-parameter-eop-model">High Precision Earth Orientation Parameter (EOP) Model</h3>

<p>The JPL EOP file is currently updated daily based on GPS and other
Earth-monitoring measurements. Horizons uses it to obtain calibrations for
UT1-UTC, polar motion, and nutation correction parameters necessary to determine
the rotation between the Earth-fixed reference frame (IRTF93) to the inertial
reference frame (ICRF).</p>

<p>The EOP file provides data from 1962 to the present, with predictions about
78 days into the future from the date of file release. For future times outside
the available EOP data-fit or prediction intervals, Horizons uses the last
predicted values available in the EOP file as constants. For historical TDB-UT
calculations prior to 1962, it switches to the published reconstruction
estimates described and referenced above.</p>

<p>Because EOP values are fit to data and include a near-term prediction interval,
it is possible an ephemeris may very slightly differ from one produced days or
weeks or months later, especially, if the original ephemeris extended into the
predicted region of the EOP file. The most recent ephemeris will be more
accurate, but if it is necessary to reproduce results exactly, contact JPL. EOP
files are archived and the one used in your initial run (indicated in your
output) can be retrieved. Generally, any numeric change over current EOP file
time-spans will be unobservable without atomic clocks and time standards at the
10^-5 seconds or better.</p>

<h3 id="body-rotations">Body Rotations</h3>

<p>The current IAU rotational models for the planets and satellites are simply
extended in time as necessary. The results are therefore consistent with the
IAU rotational models, including any of their deficiencies: the rotation models
of some satellites may be realistically valid only for much shorter periods of
time, such as around the Voyager spacecraft encounters, and produce invalid
results outside those windows. Users should consult the IAU cartographic report
for more information and limitations on specific body models.</p>

<h2 id="a-idlimits-classanchor-under-tabastatement-of-ephemeris-limitations"><a id="limits" class="anchor-under-tab"></a>Statement of Ephemeris Limitations</h2>

<p>To produce an ephemeris, observational data (optical, VLBI, radar &amp;
spacecraft) containing measurement errors are combined with dynamical models
containing modeling imprecisions.  A best fit is developed to statistically
minimize those errors. The resulting ephemeris has an associated uncertainty
that fluctuates with time.</p>

<p>For example, only a limited percentage of asteroid orbits are known to better
than 1 arcsec in the plane-of-sky over significant periods of time. While
1991 JX center-of-mass was known to within 30 meters along the line-of-sight
during the 1995 Goldstone radar experiment, errors increase outside that
time-span. Uncertainties in major planet ephemerides range from meter to
1000+ km in the state-of-the-art JPL/DE441 ephemeris, used as the basis for
spacecraft navigation, mission planning and radar astronomy.</p>

<p>Cartesian state vectors are output in all their 16 decimal-place glory.
This does not mean all digits are physically meaningful. The full-precision
may be of interest to those studying the ephemerides or as a source of initial
conditions for subsequent integrations.</p>

<p>On top of this basic uncertainty, the mass parameter (GM) used to compute
osculating element output is rarely known to better than 5 significant figures.</p>

<p>For observer angular output tables, purely local atmospheric conditions
will affect “refraction-corrected” apparent places by several arcseconds,
more at the horizon.</p>

<p>Small-body osculating orbital elements are reported in the ICRF reference
frame of the planetary ephemeris.  This frame is currently thought to differ by
no more than 0.02 arcseconds from the old FK5 optical star catalog.</p>

<p>The Earth is assumed to be a rigid body and solid Earth tides affecting
station location are not included (generally around 70 cm). Of course,
precession and nutation effects are included, as is polar motion. TDB-TAI terms
less than 20 usec are omitted. These and other Earth-model approximations
result in topocentric station location errors, with respect to the reference
ellipsoid, of less than 2 meters.  However, many optical site positions
(latitude and longitude) are reported far less accurately and could be many
kilometers off.</p>

<p>Solar relativistic effects are included in all planet, lunar, and small body
dynamics, excluding satellites. Relativity is included in observables via 2nd
order terms in stellar aberration and the deflection of light due to gravity
fields of the Sun (and Earth, for topocentric observers).</p>

<p>Deflections due to other gravity fields can potentially have an effect at
the 10^-4 arcsec level but are not currently included here. Satellites of
other planets, such as Jupiter could experience deflections at the 10^-3 arcsec
level as well.  Light-time iterations are Newtonian. This affects light-time
convergence at the millisecond level, position at ~10^-6 arcsec level.</p>

<p>For many small natural satellites, the orbit orientation is well known,
but the position of the body along the ellipse is not. Errors may be
significant, especially for the lesser satellites of outer planets. Satellite
osculating elements output by Horizons should NOT be used to initialize a
separate integration or extrapolation. Such elements assume Keplerian motion
(two point masses, etc.) which does not match, for example, kinematic models
such as a precessing ellipse, used for some satellites. One would do better
extrapolating mean orbital elements at <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sats/elem/">https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sats/elem/</a></p>

<p>Spacecraft in low Earth orbit  (such as ISS, HST, Swift, GALEX) need
frequent updates to maintain high accuracy. LEO predicts more than a few days
into the future can have 10s or 100’s of km of error.  If accurate predicts
are needed, and the last update was more than a few days ago, an update can be
done on request.  For interplanetary spacecraft, users having high-precision
applications (such as mission data reduction) should contact JPL Solar System
Dynamics to verify the status of the specific trajectory in Horizons.</p>

<h2 id="a-idspk-classanchor-under-tabaspk-file-generation"><a id="spk" class="anchor-under-tab"></a>SPK File Generation</h2>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>An SPK file is a binary file which, using SPICE Toolkit APIs, may be
smoothly interpolated to retrieve an objects’ position and velocity at any
instant within the file time-span. Such files may be used as input to
SPICE-enabled visualization and mission design programs, allowing them to
quickly retrieve accurate target body observation and data analysis
ephemerides without having to integrate equations of motion. An SPK file
could be considered a “recording” of the integrator.</p>

<p>SPK stands for “Spacecraft and Planet Kernel”. It is a file element of the
SPICE system devised and maintained by the NAIF (Navigation and Ancillary
Information Facility) team at JPL:</p>

<p><a href="https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/index.html">https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/index.html</a></p>

<p>SPK files may hold ephemerides for any kind of spacecraft, vehicle, or solar
system body, but the SPK files produced by Horizons are only for comets and
asteroids.</p>

<p>Potential users are advised that programming and science/math skills at an
advanced college level are needed to utilize these files programmatically.
Users must have a computer with a FORTRAN or C compiler, or MATLAB or IDL,
or Python. The users’ own code must be capable of calling the appropriate
SPICE Toolkit APIs taken from the SPICE Toolkit available here:</p>

<p><a href="https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit.html">https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit.html</a></p>

<p>Internet access is needed to obtain the necessary SPICE components as well as
the SPK files generated by Horizons.</p>

<p>For details about SPICE SPK files, see the SPK tutorial:</p>

<p><a href="https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/tutorials.html">https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/tutorials.html</a></p>

<h3 id="horizons-implementation-of-small-body-spk-files">Horizons Implementation of small-body SPK files</h3>

<p>SPK files can be produced on demand using the Horizons telnet interface.
Horizons allows a maximum of 20 small-bodies per SPK file. To construct an SPK
file for a comet or asteroid, Horizons retrieves the latest orbit solution and
numerically integrates the objects’ trajectory over a user-specified time span
within 1600-2500. Internal data from the integrator (difference tables) are
written directly to the SPK file as this occurs. When a users’ application
program reads the SPK file, using SPICE Toolkit APIs, that data can be used to
reconstruct the integrator state to within machine-precision limits.</p>

<p>SPK files are capable of storing trajectory data with a fidelity greater
than 1 millimeter (more accurately than should ever be required).</p>

<p>Summary information is stored in the SPK file comment area. It can be read
using the “spacit” or “commnt” utility in the SPICE Toolkit distribution.</p>

<p>Files produced autonomously by Horizons users are considered informal file
releases and should not be used for purposes affecting the safety and success
of spacecraft hardware or missions without first contacting the JPL Solar
System Dynamics Group:</p>

<p><a href="mailto:Jon.D.Giorgini@jpl.nasa.gov">Jon.D.Giorgini@jpl.nasa.gov</a>   (SSDG analyst)</p>

<p>This is because an objects’ orbit solution may be insufficiently determined
over the chosen time-span to be suitable for some high-precision purposes, due
to the quantity of measurements available for an object, the time-span they
cover, and the objects’ dynamical path.</p>

<p>Although not stored in an SPK file, the statistical uncertainty of the
trajectory as a function of time is available from the JPL Horizons system.
This can help interpret the accuracy of the trajectory.</p>

<p>The orbit solutions used to produce SPK files on demand are updated in Horizons
as new measurements are made. Therefore, a trajectory in a previously generated
SPK file may be superceded by more recent solutions. Check the orbit solution
number for an object (given as “source” in the SPK file comments area) against
the latest Horizons entry to determine if an updated orbit solution is
available.</p>

<h2 id="a-iddastcom-classanchor-under-tabaexternal-dastcom-small-body-database"><a id="dastcom" class="anchor-under-tab"></a>External DASTCOM Small-Body Database</h2>

<p>The small-body database Horizons uses to obtain initial integrator conditions
and basic physical parameters can be retrieved and used separately outside of
Horizons:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/ftp/xfr/dastcom5.zip</code></li>
  <li><code>unzip -ao dastcom5.zip</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The .zip file is updated as warranted, but as often as hourly (between 30-32
minutes after the hour) to capture database changes.</p>

<p>Unzipping the archive will create a sub-directory with a file called
<code>./dastcom5/doc/README.txt</code>, explaining usage.</p>

<p>Other directories will contain the latest FORTRAN source code for a reader
library and application program called <code>dxlook</code> which accesses the database
interactively or with scripts.</p>

<p>The DASTCOM5 package is intended for programmers comfortable with
UNIX/LINUX/MacOSX command-line usage.</p>
