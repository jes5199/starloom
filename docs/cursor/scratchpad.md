# Implement WeftEphemeris Source for Starloom

## Task
Implement a new ephemeris source that reads data from weftball archives (tar.gz) without extracting them to disk.

## Goal
Enable running: `starloom ephemeris mercury --date now --source weft --data mercury_weftball.tar.gz`

## TODOs
[X] Create new module structure for weft_ephemeris
[X] Create WeftEphemeris class implementing the ephemeris interface
[X] Add ability to read .tar.gz files without extraction
[X] Implement weft file parsing to extract positional data
[X] Register the new source in the CLI module
[ ] Test with various planets and dates
[ ] Handle error cases (missing files, invalid data)

## Implementation Notes
- Need to understand the weft file format for parsing
- Will use Python's tarfile module for accessing archives
- Must implement the same interface as other ephemeris sources (HorizonsEphemeris, etc.)
- Need to extract longitude, latitude, and distance data

## Potential Issues
1. Currently we write temporary files to disk during loading. This is not ideal - we should find a way to create WeftReader instances directly from bytes without temporary files.
2. Error handling could be improved with more specific error messages.
3. We may need to handle normalization of angles (longitude) to ensure values are in the expected range.
4. The implementation assumes specific filenames within the archive - we might need to make this more flexible.

## Next Steps
1. Test with real weftball files
2. Optimize the temporary file handling to avoid disk I/O
3. Add better error handling and logging
4. Consider supporting more quantities beyond the basic three
