# Test Failure Analysis - 2025-01-01

## Issues Identified
1. ~~Missing `prefetch_data` method in `CachedHorizonsEphemeris`~~ (RESOLVED)
   - `prefetch_data` functionality is now handled by `get_planet_positions`
   - Test needs to be updated to use new API
2. TypeError in `EphemerisDataSource` tests: datetime doesn't define `__round__` method

## Action Items
[X] ~~Add `prefetch_data` method to `CachedHorizonsEphemeris`~~ 
    - Instead, update test to use `get_planet_positions`
[ ] Fix datetime rounding issues in `EphemerisDataSource`

## Analysis
### Test Failures:
1. `test_prefetch_data` - ~~Missing method implementation~~ Outdated test
   - Test should be updated to use `get_planet_positions` instead
   - `get_planet_positions` provides same functionality with better implementation
2. Multiple `EphemerisDataSource` tests failing with same datetime rounding error
   - Affects value retrieval at bounds
   - Affects interpolation
   - Affects range operations

### Debug Output Analysis:
- System is fetching ephemeris data for 2025-01-01 to 2025-01-02
- Data structure shows only ECLIPTIC_LONGITUDE being returned
- Possible data completeness issue to investigate later

## Current Focus
1. ~~First implement missing prefetch_data method~~ Update test to use new API
2. Then investigate datetime rounding issues
