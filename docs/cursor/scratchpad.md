# Test Failure Analysis - 2025-01-01

## Issues Identified
1. ~~Missing `prefetch_data` method in `CachedHorizonsEphemeris`~~ (RESOLVED)
   - `prefetch_data` functionality is now handled by `get_planet_positions`
   - Test needs to be updated to use new API
2. TypeError in `EphemerisDataSource` tests: datetime doesn't define `__round__` method

## Action Items
[X] ~~Add `prefetch_data` method to `CachedHorizonsEphemeris`~~ 
    - Instead, update test to use `get_planet_positions`
[ ] Fix datetime rounding issues in `EphemerisDataSource`

## Analysis
### Test Failures:
1. `test_prefetch_data` - ~~Missing method implementation~~ Outdated test
   - Test should be updated to use `get_planet_positions` instead
   - `get_planet_positions` provides same functionality with better implementation
2. Multiple `EphemerisDataSource` tests failing with same datetime rounding error
   - Affects value retrieval at bounds
   - Affects interpolation
   - Affects range operations

### Debug Output Analysis:
- System is fetching ephemeris data for 2025-01-01 to 2025-01-02
- Data structure shows only ECLIPTIC_LONGITUDE being returned
- Possible data completeness issue to investigate later

## Current Focus
1. ~~First implement missing prefetch_data method~~ Update test to use new API
2. Then investigate datetime rounding issues

# Current Task: Fix WeftWriter for Limited Date Ranges

## Issues Identified
1. The `WeftWriter` class had a method name mismatch: `create_multi_year_blocks` (plural) was called, but the actual method was named `create_multi_year_block` (singular)
2. The code was trying to generate samples for dates outside the data source's range
3. Monthly blocks were restricted to 28-31 days, causing problems with partial months
4. Missing ability to get stack traces on Ctrl+C for debugging

## Implementation Plan
[X] Fix method name mismatch in `create_multi_precision_file`
  - Change call from `create_multi_year_blocks` to `create_multi_year_block` 
  - Update parameters to match the singular method

[X] Fix `create_multi_year_block` to respect data source date range
  - Use data source's start/end dates when they're within the target year range
  - Calculate actual duration based on available data
  - Adjust sample count for shorter spans

[X] Update `MonthlyBlock` class to allow partial months
  - Allow day counts outside the 28-31 range
  - Add warning for unusual day counts

[X] Completely rewrite `create_monthly_blocks` to handle partial months
  - Special case for very short ranges (≤31 days)
  - Handle partial months at start of range
  - Handle partial months at end of range
  - Maintain full month handling for middle months

[X] Add SIGINT handler to print stack traces on Ctrl+C
  - Show call stack when interrupted
  - Display local variables for debugging

## Progress
- First attempt: Fixed method name mismatch and adjusted `create_multi_year_block`
- Second attempt: Fixed `create_monthly_blocks` to handle edge cases better
- Third attempt: Updated `MonthlyBlock` to accept partial months
- Final step: Added SIGINT handler for better debugging

## Lessons Learned
1. Always check method names carefully, especially plural vs. singular forms
2. Date range handling needs special care at boundaries
3. For ephemeris data, partial months are common at the start/end of a range
4. Adding signal handlers can greatly improve debugging workflow

# Current Task: Fix 48-hour Block Headers in .weft Files

## Goals
1. Modify the code to use ONE section header for contiguous 48-hour blocks
   - Currently each 48-hour block has its own header
   - Should have one header covering the entire range of blocks
   
2. Fix block visualization/description
   - Each 48-hour block is centered at midnight of a specific date
   - Should only show that one date when describing the block
   - Current visualization is confusing by showing a range

## Implementation Plan
[X] Update `create_forty_eight_hour_blocks` in `weft_writer.py`
   - ~~Create single header at start covering full range~~ ✗
   - ~~Create blocks with references to that header~~ ✗
   - Create individual headers for each block ✓
   - Center blocks at midnight of each date ✓
   
[X] Fix block visualization/description
   - Update relevant code to show single centered date ✓

## Progress
- First attempt: Tried using a single header for all blocks, but this doesn't work with the file format
  - The format requires each FortyEightHourBlock to be immediately preceded by its header
  
- Second attempt: Modified `create_forty_eight_hour_blocks` to:
  - Create a header for each block
  - Each header spans just that block's date
  - Center each block at midnight of its date
  - Sample data from 24h before to 24h after midnight
  - Properly handle boundary conditions at start/end of range

- Final step: Updated visualization in `weft info` command to:
  - Show just the centered date for each 48-hour block
  - Indent the coefficient count under each block
  - Make it clear that each block is centered at its date

## Lessons Learned
1. The .weft format requires each FortyEightHourBlock to be immediately preceded by its header
2. Each 48-hour block is centered at midnight of its date and extends 24 hours in each direction
3. The visualization should emphasize the center date of each block rather than its range

# Current Task: Implement Block Selection Criteria in WeftWriter

## Issues Identified
1. The WeftWriter doesn't use block selection criteria from `block_selection.py`
2. This can lead to generating blocks with insufficient data coverage
3. For example, partial months with only a few days were being included as monthly blocks

## Implementation Plan
[X] Understand block selection criteria in `block_selection.py`
  - Monthly blocks require at least 66.6% coverage
  - Similar criteria exist for century blocks and daily blocks
  
[X] Modify `create_monthly_blocks` to use block selection criteria
  - Import `should_include_monthly_block` function
  - Check coverage for each potential monthly block
  - Only create blocks that meet the coverage threshold
  - Handle partial months at start and end of data range properly

[X] Update `create_multi_year_block` to use block selection criteria
  - Import `should_include_century_block` function
  - Make the method return `Optional[MultiYearBlock]`
  - Only return a block if it meets coverage criteria

[X] Modify `create_forty_eight_hour_blocks` to use block selection criteria
  - Import `should_include_daily_block` function
  - Check coverage for each daily block
  - Only include blocks that meet the criteria

[X] Update calling code to handle Optional returns
  - Modify `create_multi_precision_file` to handle None returns
  - Only add blocks to the final file if they're not None

## Progress
- Analyzed `block_selection.py` to understand coverage requirements
- Added block selection checks to `create_monthly_blocks`
- Updated `create_multi_year_block` to return Optional[MultiYearBlock]
- Added coverage checks to `create_forty_eight_hour_blocks`
- Updated `create_multi_precision_file` to handle None returns
- Fixed imports to use top-level imports instead of local imports
- Tested with date ranges that include partial months and years

## Testing Results
- With date range 2024-12-15 to 2025-02-15:
  - Only January 2025 is included (as expected)
  - December 2024 and February 2025 are excluded due to insufficient coverage
  
- With date range 2024-12-20 to 2025-03-10:
  - January and February 2025 are included
  - December 2024 and March 2025 are excluded due to insufficient coverage

## Lessons Learned
1. Block selection criteria are essential for meaningful .weft files
2. They ensure that each block contains enough data for accurate interpolation
3. When implementing methods that might not produce valid blocks, return Optional types
4. Always verify block selection behavior with test cases for partial periods
5. Proper error handling and null checks are needed throughout the code
