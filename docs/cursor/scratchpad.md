# Test Failure Analysis - 2025-01-01

## Issues Identified
1. ~~Missing `prefetch_data` method in `CachedHorizonsEphemeris`~~ (RESOLVED)
   - `prefetch_data` functionality is now handled by `get_planet_positions`
   - Test needs to be updated to use new API
2. TypeError in `EphemerisDataSource` tests: datetime doesn't define `__round__` method

## Action Items
[X] ~~Add `prefetch_data` method to `CachedHorizonsEphemeris`~~ 
    - Instead, update test to use `get_planet_positions`
[ ] Fix datetime rounding issues in `EphemerisDataSource`

## Analysis
### Test Failures:
1. `test_prefetch_data` - ~~Missing method implementation~~ Outdated test
   - Test should be updated to use `get_planet_positions` instead
   - `get_planet_positions` provides same functionality with better implementation
2. Multiple `EphemerisDataSource` tests failing with same datetime rounding error
   - Affects value retrieval at bounds
   - Affects interpolation
   - Affects range operations

### Debug Output Analysis:
- System is fetching ephemeris data for 2025-01-01 to 2025-01-02
- Data structure shows only ECLIPTIC_LONGITUDE being returned
- Possible data completeness issue to investigate later

## Current Focus
1. ~~First implement missing prefetch_data method~~ Update test to use new API
2. Then investigate datetime rounding issues

# Current Task: Fix 48-hour Block Headers in .weft Files

## Goals
1. Modify the code to use ONE section header for contiguous 48-hour blocks
   - Currently each 48-hour block has its own header
   - Should have one header covering the entire range of blocks
   
2. Fix block visualization/description
   - Each 48-hour block is centered at midnight of a specific date
   - Should only show that one date when describing the block
   - Current visualization is confusing by showing a range

## Implementation Plan
[X] Update `create_forty_eight_hour_blocks` in `weft_writer.py`
   - ~~Create single header at start covering full range~~ ✗
   - ~~Create blocks with references to that header~~ ✗
   - Create individual headers for each block ✓
   - Center blocks at midnight of each date ✓
   
[X] Fix block visualization/description
   - Update relevant code to show single centered date ✓

## Progress
- First attempt: Tried using a single header for all blocks, but this doesn't work with the file format
  - The format requires each FortyEightHourBlock to be immediately preceded by its header
  
- Second attempt: Modified `create_forty_eight_hour_blocks` to:
  - Create a header for each block
  - Each header spans just that block's date
  - Center each block at midnight of its date
  - Sample data from 24h before to 24h after midnight
  - Properly handle boundary conditions at start/end of range

- Final step: Updated visualization in `weft info` command to:
  - Show just the centered date for each 48-hour block
  - Indent the coefficient count under each block
  - Make it clear that each block is centered at its date

## Lessons Learned
1. The .weft format requires each FortyEightHourBlock to be immediately preceded by its header
2. Each 48-hour block is centered at midnight of its date and extends 24 hours in each direction
3. The visualization should emphasize the center date of each block rather than its range
