# Instructions

During your interactions with users, you should maintain notes in the `/docs/cursor/lessons.md` file about any reusable information discovered (e.g., library versions, model names), especially regarding corrections or fixes to previous mistakes. This helps prevent repeating the same mistakes.

Use the `/docs/cursor/scratchpad.md` file to organize your thoughts. When receiving a new task:
1. Review the current scratchpad content
2. Clear any unrelated previous task notes
3. Explain the new task
4. Plan the required steps

Track progress using todo markers, for example:
[X] Completed task
[ ] Pending task

Update the scratchpad as you complete subtasks. After reaching milestones, use the scratchpad to reflect and plan next steps. This helps maintain both a high-level overview and detailed progress tracking of the task. Always consult the scratchpad when planning your next steps.

For longer running tasks that might span multiple sessions and be project-wide goals, use a similar format in /docs/cursor/TODO.md, but this should default towards persisting indefinitely - don't just clear it out.
